I dont care what META (Facebook) is doing for the crypto sphere NO ONE should be using their services after the blatant data abuses by the company formerly known as Facebook,How can I put this🤔Facebook is like a really invasive stalker or ex who plants bugs and uses tech to know your every move you dont like it but every time they get into trouble there you are with your check book bailing them out of jail.Thats what META is they are that invasive stalker who scoops up and sells your information but you keep giving them access to your lives....WHY?How anyone can believe a company with Facebooks track record of data mining wouldnt track EVERYTHING YOU DO IN THE METAVERSE? How can you have any faith in the meta coin when Zuckerberg has done nothing but worsen the human condition? The man literally just said meta will be tracking your facial expressions while using meta to better serve you ok Im sure. For god sake I just dont get it,17338,0.92,3126,2022-01-20 15:08:13

I mean this in the absolute nicest way possible but some of you just need to get a job,Its no secret that a significant portion of this sub are small time investors and while not inspirational its also no secret that it takes money to make money. I mean what Im about to say as genuine advice not to make fun of anyone but a lot of people here really need to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. Every day we have people stressing and speculating over the day-to-day movements of their crypto panicking over bear markets asking where should I invest this spare $50?! in the daily. When in reality they could see their portfolio do a 2x by working a few solid minimum wage shifts and dumping the paycheck into crypto. A nice 20% pump on the $100 you invested in your favourite alt-coin which you spent hours researching still only leaves you with $20 profit. You could probably ask your mom for $20 and shed give it to you. It might be a harsh truth but crypto isnt a life-changing opportunity until youre working with a decent stack of money until then conventional money-making methods are faster and more lucrative (without the potential downside of investing!)Its not what you want to hear but a couple hundred dollars in the market isnt going to make you financially free unless youre the crypto-embracing second coming of Warren Buffett. Grinding out a real life job and dumping that money into crypto? That might just do the trick though.**Important disclaimer/reminder** I mean ZERO hate to small time investors whatsoever with this post. You guys are learning essential lessons and gaining investing experience without the risk and potential downside of others with more skin in the game and most importantly small amounts of money can mean a hell of a lot more to some people than others. Im simply saying look at the bigger picture and make the most of your time. Crypto becomes more rewarding the more you can safely invest into it typical jobs might not have the potential of crypto but they will build you a base and give you a start way faster and safer.,14165,0.86,2105,2022-01-24 11:34:30

99% of the crypto market has 0 real life utility. Change my mind.,Other than a speculative asset with a glorious whitepaper and an impressive ex workers of big name companies all around the world they all promise the Moon but underdeliver. I have yet to see something that has an actual use in realife that is using any of those tokens/coins technology. I understand that there are companies looking into metaverse NFTs or accepting Bitcoin as legal tender but those are very niche and farfrom mass adoption.Honestly talking the only projects ive seen of use are cost cutting protocols such as MATIC & LRC for transactions and Brave Browser (BAT) which i actually find it awesome to use.Do you have other opinion? Are we throwing money into the void?Are we any different from gambling our money if the rate of uselessness is so high?,12763,0.85,6552,2022-01-31 13:05:42

The market is crashing and so is Crypto.,The harsh truth is the Fed is tightening its monetary policies and theyre going to be raising interest rates very soon. The inflation rate is now too much to ignore as the people realize that their buying power is deteriorating faster and faster with little being done about it. As money is harder to get with the Fed reducing its balance sheet there will be less money to invest into Crypto and the market.# The Crash Has Already StartedWhen the Fed announced it was going to be raising interest rates I warned about a market crash in a post I made just 10 days ago. Unfortunately the crash I was talking about has already started as the stock market has started going down very intensely.[Nasdaq Index Falling](https//preview.redd.it/c1prsr60x0d81.png?width=843&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b0b9fcffc58081d9477139f54bf4334b97e94c3)The pace at which the stock market is going down can very likely cause a situation like weve seen in 2008. This is going to cause panic and sell offs among people. We can already see people cashing out their stock market gains due to recent price action.# Surging Inflation and Market CrashIf we see the history every time there was high inflation the Fed artificially triggered a market crash by aggressively increasing interest rates.[Inflation and Interest rate correlation](https//preview.redd.it/wd2srkb9x0d81.png?width=982&format=png&auto=webp&s=628ff4587a8298793996352607cec9b84c928f16)This rise in interest rate and the planned decrease of the Feds balance sheet is going to have a severe impact on the market as people start borrowing less spending less and investments into all assets start to dwindle.# Biden Approval Rating[Approval Ratings Fall Sharply Due To Inflation Concerns](https//preview.redd.it/tbvvccadx0d81.png?width=1281&format=png&auto=webp&s=e10b55e73781fccb335a8fb7f7203a709023a84b)With more and more inflation people are losing trust in the Government and the approval rating is going down. The main reason behind this huge fall in approval rating is inflation and the government needs to tackle inflation if they want to keep their approval rating from falling even lower as the public takes notice of their bills. The approval rating is a sign that the government needs to tackle inflation if it wants to keep public support.# The Sell-off and the OpportunityWith the market crash ahead being very likely people are taking their money out faster and faster. The Fed is no longer giving them free money very soon. The amount of people that are buying assets very low considering the current situation and it is likely going to start going down as the interest rates are yet to be increased which is when we will see the peak effects of the upcoming crash.However when crashes are at their peak they leave most assets EXTREMELY undervalued. These are the times when you want to dump money into things like Crypto which can rise extremely fast during a bullish market.# Cryptos Correspondence With the Stock MarketThe Cryptocurrency market is strongly correlated with the stock market especially after more and more institutions have started to invest in Crypto. The Crypto market WILL react if there is a downtrend in the general economy. That is basically the reason we saw another dip in Cryptos prices today.**TLDR** The Fed will be tightening its monetary policies due to inflation and the stock market has started to crash. With the stock market starting to go down were already seeing the Crypto market react today and unfortunately if the general market continues to dip so will Crypto.,10902,0.85,5465,2022-01-21 11:11:15

Alright I admit it I work in tech I have been in crypto for 4 years or so and I genuinely have no idea what crypto is used for other than an investment or money transfer product. You can make apps on it?,*Edit to clarify I like crypto myself got a punk rock vibe to it. I just dont know what all it gets used for. Also the job in tech is internal tools dev at a medium sized game publisher.**Edit again Guys the whole point of this post was I dont know shit about what I bought. Regardless of what I think seems like its worth investing in Im the LAST person you should be asking for crypto advice. Ive gotten multiple DMs. What the fuck lol*Yep. I think about this constantly I understand the use case for something like Bitcoin. Transfer money with no middle men. I get that.What the hell are these other chains supposed to be doing? Half my damn portfolio is Ethereum and I genuinely cant tell you what youre supposed to do with it. Why would you develop an app on a Blockchain? Let alone how. Is there some inherent benefit here? God I have no clue.For the longest time I just thought it was like providing a decentralized version of something like AWS or Azure like a grass roots server host. Holy shit I was wrong. Theres all sorts of shit you can make apparently.But yeah idk. Feels good to come clean. I got into it cause it seemed like a smart investment and so far so good. But Im amazed Ive not come across any real application of it in my day to day life so far that Im aware of at least.I cannot be alone here right? Please. Its wild to me that I understand more about the idea behind what an NFT is (supposed to be) used for than any application of any other blockchains.Idk if anyone else is in this camp and feels dumb youre not alone. I feel ya.-------**Alright so I went to bed came back and this thread exploded. In an attempt to Give back to this community that is actually full of  pretty helpful people amongst all the people dont know shit about fuck memes ill share some of what Ive learned for anyone taking a glance at this post;*** **Right now currency transfers is the king application.** Send money from point A to B without interference or approval from the man thats a valuable service and for the most part thats a very simple summary of the idea of what gives a coin like bitcoin its value. Okay cool easy starting point out of the way.* **There are actually a few quite a few blockchains that offer a more tangible service now.** Storage processing power internet browsers etc. Something you can either open up on your PC and use as a regular application or something you can plan on using with a development project. I wont name specifics ones because there were a lot mentioned but right now if youre looking for a product you can use these are where they find their niche. Feels and seems kind of like a natural evolution of peer to peer applications from back in the day thats the example Im using to help myself understand it a bit theres probably a better way.* **Blockchains** ***can*** **trim a lot of the fat off of most recordkeeping and proof of ownership processes but for the most part havent... yet?** Most havent found any real adoption for processes that have some sort of regulation agency behind it. Which makes sense Im assuming its incredibly rare that any department of any government would be likely to agree to dissolve itself due to being obsolete. The question remains with crypto record keeping how do you butt heads against something like that? This one is a broad generalized sense of what I got in the comments I know there are cases otherwise.* **Apps Dapps and a bunch of other terms.** So a lot of people seem to take it as a jab because it seems like it gets used as a jab to overly summarize it by saying most crypto applications are applications built on crypto to help you trade crypto?. But for the most part that seems pretty true. For now at least.  It seems like the real application of Dapps has yet to be realized. Which I want to clarify I dont think totally discredits them nobody could imagine any of the applications of early era internet environments. Just makes it hard to figure out whats going on. (Also Im just talking majority of cases here. there ARE some apps that arent just for moving crypto around more efficiently but my understanding is still too caveman to have brought them up.),10019,0.87,4691,2022-01-11 11:38:50

Coinbase have stolen my Eth deposit and ignored my correspondence with them. A quick search of their support sub reveals they do this a lot and apparently theyre getting away with it.,I deposited ETH from an address I have used many times to my CB address I have used many times without issues. Deposit made on Christmas day 2021.I got the usual CB email saying theyd received my deposit and the tx is confirmed on etherscan.The coins were never put into my portfolio.I opened a support ticket and got a vague non-answer by reply (were looking into it). It was promptly closed without explanation. I have since opened another 3 tickets which have all been met with similar vague responses and then the tickets are closed without explanation. My requests to make a complaint have been ignored. I posted on their subreddit 2 weeks ago and got another vague response no DMs etc.Ive posted there again today but dont expect much.My account is not suspended etc. I am still able to transact with existing funds and deposit fiat. I tested this yesterday.The funny thing is I trade high volume and had I continued using CBP I would have paid them multiples of the value of this deposit in fees over the next 12 months. Congrats you played yourselves.I was able to live with CBP constantly going down during periods of volatility (sus AF!) but this is crossing the line.**I am purely posting to encourage others to stay away from coinbase and CBP.** I am not the first person this has happened to. There are literally hundreds of posts like mine on their support sub where people have had funds vanish and the support team just ignores them.Aside from this their fee structure sucks anyway. People seem think CBP is the cheapest for fees but theyre only the cheapest if you trade over $100k per month. I only used them because it was a quick cash onramp from my Revolut account. Ill be sticking with Binance and Kraken from here on out. I will also be looking at the LRC DEX because they pay you to trade.Be careful where you leave your funds.EDIT Lots of people doubting the legitimacy of my post which I guess is healthy skepticism. When I get home from work I will redact my personal details and edit in links to my (very one sided) correspondence with Coinbase.Edit 2 Ive done the above with mods.**Edit 3 RESOLUTION!** Thank you all so much for your support. Im happy to report that Coinbase were **magically** able to resolve my issue straight away after I tagged their reddit support account on this post. I received the mail in this imagehttps//ibb.co/b61rYK8I went straight to filing a complaint and within about 10 minutes my account was credited with the missing funds. They have devalued by about 30% ish since I sent them and I sent them to be sold immediately at the time but I seriously doubt Ill get anything else out of CB. Im just glad to get my coins back at last.Thank you all again. Naming and shaming most definitely works.Also a final word a lot of people are looking for alternative exchange recommendations. I am in the EU and use binance a lot also have a Kraken account and they have been recommended by a lot of people. But I know these arent great options for some people in the USA.Im also going to look at using the LRC DEX for trading as they pay you to trade via negative fees! Amazing. I dont believe theres any geo blocks on this either. The issue I experienced makes me think DEXs are the way forward.Good luck to everyone this year dont forget to buy high and sell low 🚀,13377,0.91,1415,2022-02-09 13:17:52
I recently acquired 80000 ETH for a very very good price and now I dont know what to do with it. Any help?,Yesterday I was doing some good old arbitrage trading between Solana and Ethereum and I managed to get my hands on 80000 ETH for a really low price - so low in fact that you wouldnt believe me if I told you how I pulled off this deal.Now I dont know what to do with all this ETH. Its worth approximately 250 millions USD which is not bad if you ask me. Should I stake it all and get the 4% rewards? This way I would get passive income something like 10 millions USD/year which is theoritically enough for my family to live a comfortable life. Also by staking I would be contributing to the security of the blockchain which is a big plus for me - I wanna do my part!But is this the best course of action for me?I also thought about getting into liquidity pools **but I am afraid of smart contract risks**. What if I put all my ETH into a LP on Solana and then some asshole comes and drain the contract? I worked very hard for this ETH that would suck. And theres also the risk of impermanent loss - what if my ETH on Solana decoupled from the ETH on mainnet?Anyway thanks everyone and I look forward to read your ideas.,8972,0.77,2397,2022-02-03 14:07:44
Why Crypto culture is so cringe?,I just dont understand how this kind of lame aesthetic/taste became popular in crypto community. Something like profile pic with blue glowing eyes? Abbreviation like WAGMI? Emojis like  🚀🚀🚀 and space floods with degenerated/ugly JPG NFTs. I have no question why people from outside see crypto community as a joke and hate it a lot. Because this crypto culture just demonstrates/represents how superficial and greedy the community is.

El Salvador holds less than 2% of its reserves in BTC they hold more GOLD than BTC. People are spreading the false narrative that they are recklessly gambling with peoples money. 2% allocation is a decent riskreward. Even Fidelity allocates 2% to BTC in their flagship Balanced Fund.,Lots of people here keep spreading the narrative that El Salvador is gambling recklessly with peoples savings and what not. Reading those posts one would think their entire reserves is now in BTC.But the fact is that just 2% of their reserves are even allocated in BTC. [El Salvador holds around $70m worth BTC](https//bitcointreasuries.net/). This is literally nothing for a country.

People are spreading the false narrative as if he has moved the entire supply of reserves to BTC which is far away from whats going on.They have just been making small purchases over time. They literally bought like 2 BTC in the end of Dec. Peanuts for a country.A 2% allocation in a risky asset class is not a gamble by any means. It is a decent risk reward play for individuals and countries as well. If you consult with a financial advisor they may suggest a portfolio allocation of 2% towards emerging asset classes like crypto. Infact thats what Fidelity suggests as well. [Recently they added a 2% BTC allocation to their flagship All in one Balanced / Growth funds](https//www.investmentexecutive.com/news/products/fidelity-to-add-bitcoin-exposure-to-portfolio-funds/). These are mom and pop funds that are held mostly by conservative investors. Its been around a year since El Salvador announced their Bitcoin Law and around 6 months since it went active. In this period they have allocated a small portion of their reserves towards BTC. This is not a gamble but a solid  and well planned asset allocation strategy. Meanwhile they have already started mining BTC and over time this industry has the potential to add to their GDP. What did people think bitcoin/crypto adoption would be like one fine day every country across the world will just start accepting BTC out of the blue? Just like that it would become legal tender without any struggle? These are small steps and it will be risky. Nothing happened overnight let alone moving from USD to a decentralised currency like Bitcoin.Its shameful that people here want adoption of BTC and crypto but the first time a large sovereign power has tried to adopt BTC the same people who want crypto adoption go out of their way to attack them with baseless allegations. > Muhh adoption should be in accordance with my terms otherwise its not adoption. These people are just privileged bottom feeders who want to enjoy success without any risks whatsoever.,8240,0.91,1278,2022-01-26 14:23:17

Ill focus on 2022 Top Ten Portfolio reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis (down to two reports per month)2. Incorporated Decentralized Finance (DeFi) for the first time. 3. Factoring in stablecoin gains  In past years I have not included the ROI that is possible with stables in the monthly reports.  This year I will detail ways to build on the $100 of USDC in the 2022 portfolio and gamify it a bit my goal is to outperform as many as the other cryptos in the 2022 Top Ten Portfolio as possible (simple if it turns out to be a bear year a bit more challenging if the 2022 market moons).4. Giveaways Who doesnt love a good old fashioned giveaway? Ill be giving away crypto during the year either through Twitter Reddit or my email list. Im still figuring out the details but aim to give away around $100 a month in crypto.5. Friendly competition I will compare my homemade 2022 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment to a Total Crypto Market Cap Index Token ($TCAP r/TotalCryptoMarketCap) to see which one outperforms.And here we go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!## Four Year Report – UP 34%https//preview.redd.it/c3c6wlctpgb81.jpg?width=1056&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=380248b14486edaa5749fba7a390198bf81260a0Welcome to the four year report!The 2018 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is **BTC XRP ETH BCH ADA LTC IOTA NEM Dash** and **Stellar**.  December highlights for the 2018 Top Ten Portfolio* **100% red month**. **IOTA** falls the least only down -4% (on news that staking on the Firefly wallet will yield two cryptos Assembly and Shimmer).* **ETH** maintains a solid overall lead **BTC** in second place **ADA** in third.  Three coins in the green since January 2018.* After four years the 2018 Portfolio is +34% behind the S&P 500s ROI over the same time period.## December Ranking and DropoutsHeres a look at the movement in ranks since January 2018https//preview.redd.it/ulc9dwgvpgb81.jpg?width=412&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2eadc9a98ec75b726cef37af7cb716fddf3126db**Top Ten dropouts since January 2018** After four years of the 2018 Top Ten Experiment only 40% of the cryptos that [started in the Top Ten](https//toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) have remained.  **NEM Dash Stellar Bitcoin Cash IOTA** and **Litecoin** have been replaced by **Binance Coin Tether** **DOT SOL** **LUNA** and **USDC.  NEM** looks like it wants to be the first to drop out of the Top 100.## December Winners and Losers***December Winners*** –  **IOTA** outperformed the pack dropping only -4% this month. 100% of the cryptos in the red.***December Losers*** –   Losing nearly a third of its value **Litecoin** fell the most down -30%. **NEM** followed **LTC** dropping -27% in December.## Tally of Monthly Winners and LosersAfter four years heres a tally of the monthly winners and losers over the life of the 2018 Top Ten Experiment. https//preview.redd.it/lisz7rgxpgb81.jpg?width=411&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cbf41f94e9716f0140f3a7dfff3f655fa9d21a59With 11 **Bitcoin** has two more monthly wins than second place **Cardano**.  **NEM** has finished last place most often (12 months out of 48).**Bitcoin** is still the only cryptocurrency that hasnt yet lost a month since January 2018 (although it has come very close a couple of times).## Overall Update –  2021 ends with a whimper.

Indian government announces it will bring crypto under legal framework taxable at 30% of gains. No capital losses or business expenses allowed,Indian government just announced that crypto will be taxed at 30% of gains. This is the first time the Indian government is discussing crypto taxation. The tax will apply to all gains on digital virtual assets and no capital losses will be allowed. Business expenses will also not  be allowed.Gifts in the form of digital currency will be also taxed in the hands of the receiver.This is a landmark announcement as the first time the Indian government is announcing any law or regulation around crypto. So far nothing concrete was announced except rumors in the media. Now crypto being a taxable asset will lead to growth of adoption of crypto in India> I propose to provide that any income from transfer of any virtual digital asset shall be taxed at the rate of 30%. No deduction in respect of any expenditure or allowance shall be allowed while computing such income except cost of acquisition FM Nirmala SitharamanEdit  Some sources are saying capital gains losses is not allowed only for offsetting it with other income sources. But it is still allowed within crypto. Waiting for more clarity on this.Edit 2 ~~It seems completely no capital losses.~~ https//www.indiabudget.gov.in/doc/memo.pdfLaw mentions aggregate income from crypto transfers - some seem to think this means crypto losses can be offset among crypto itself. > However no deduction in respect of any expenditure (other than cost of acquisition) or allowance or set off of any loss shall be allowed to the assessee under any provision of the Act while computing income from transfer of such asset> Further no set off of any loss arising from transfer of virtual digital asset shall be allowed against any income computed under any other provision of the Act and such loss shall not be allowed to be carried forward to subsequent assessment years.Edit 3 Most reaction seem to suggest 30% is really harsh. Especially when long term capital gains from stocks is like 10%. 30% will apply for developers and builders too which will mean they will move to friendly tax jurisdictions rather than remain in India. Seems like a dumb and self defeating policy tbh.The law taxes not profits but even transfers. So even simple actions like staking or moving funds or using a smart contract would become taxable. This is insane. Projects that originated in India like Polygon are already moving out experts say most crypto companies will follow suit as a crypto native company doesnt want to deal with 30% tax for every transaction they makeTaxation is at 30% of gains if you are investing. If you are earning 100% of your income through crypto (lots of Indian freelancers/developers are the tax will be at 30% of total income which is definitely harsh)Edit 4 CEX like WazirX and CoinDCX will now automatically report trades to the tax authorities as TDS. This is similar to other TDS tax deducted at source policies.  So if you are using them the gov will now automatically find out about your trades. While the tax provisions are definitely bad for Indian users it creates clarity so now some rich guy with a few millions to spare who was interested in crypto but waiting on the sidelines wondering if it will be totally prohibited or not can start investing as they know its not prohibited but taxed heavily. Could lead to more Indians getting in (i.e. Le india pamp)**TLDR Govt is taxing all crypto transactions including simple transfers at a flat 30% tax. No capital losses or business expenses allowed. In the same day govt reduced corporate taxes to lowest in Asia and offered loan and debt waivers for corporates. Fuel prices are soaring. There is literally nothing in this budget if you are middle class common person. If you run a billion dollar company well there are few sops in it. Someone earning their income through crypto will get shafted. Massively anti-poor/anti-middle class pro-elites pro those who fund this sham government headed by dictator Modi. Honestly fuck this.. I hope they get routed in the upcoming elections but wont have high hopes as most of the country has been sucked into their hate fuelled religious brand politics**,5974,0.92,2007,2022-02-01 06:55:17
Its actually impressive how fast people lose interest in crypto.,Down by 50% ? Rip the crypto market is dead and stocks are superior since they only went down by 2%.Oh crypto is up by 100%? God damn I should yolo my life savings.Oh shit I just lost the mortgage cuz crypto went down by 40% again.Seriously why do people get shocked when this happens? If youre new to the market I understand but if youve been around since 2017 or even 2020 then you should know better than this.Its surreal how fast the mood changes from Crypto currency is the future to Everything in Crypto sucksAnd maybe thats why crypto is a joke to the non-cryptoers.,5909,0.85,4537,2022-01-22 09:03:34
President of El Salvador Nayib Bukeke updates profile picture to McDonalds. No matter what happens to the price dont lose your sense of humor,Nayib Bukeke has been catching flak from all sides as many have questioned his decisions to buy Bitcoin. He recently bought the dip. [However as the dip dipped he has changed his profile picture. ](https//preview.redd.it/goninpvicdd81.jpg?width=1400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5dac20d1b67f6706d4bc173e3858a6e6e7c043c8)Atleast he is owning it. Though some will say its not his money its his countrys money but a lot of El Salvadors economy now depends on Bitcoin - from volcano mining and now their bitcoin bonds that are going to be issued for raising funds after El Salvador showed the finger to IMF. Some people take hard and painful decisions in these times that can cause pain to family and friends. Its worth remembering that money is not everything. If you have lost an obscene amount of unrealised gains its best to make peace with it than to keep beating yourself up over it.Edit LOL so many people embarrassing themselves and crying in comments. Looks like after this crash a sense of humor is out of their budgetEdit 2 The hot takes here from a lot of trolls coming in from other subs like r/technology are ridiculous. Let El Salvador/Bukele do what he wants to do give him the time to decide if the experiment has failed or not. If it fails so be it. I mean thousands of government policies have failed. He isnt buying BTC to get rich over night. Its a long term policy decision for him. While you claim he is wasting tax payer money he is actually putting his reputation on the chopping block here which is more than anything you can claim. If his economy collapses its gonna be him on the opposite end of a coup or worse. That country is no stranger to presidents being overthrown in violence.All the big brains here concerned about El Salvadors economy imploding all of a sudden where were all of you 3 years ago when the nation was just the same warn torn and filled with cartels? You didnt care then when the past presidents over ran the country with gang violence? Oh yeah you didnt even know the country existed. Now that they are trying something new with BTC it suddenly hurts your feelings so much. El Salvador have already started mining BTC from volcano energy that was being wasted it represents a completely new income stream in a country that mainly depends only on tourism and remittances. Many reports already suggest the locals are able to save middle men fees by using BTC while kicking out predators like Western Union. He has kicked IMF out American media will do everything to portray him in a bad light and all you will parrot what you read in the media. Where were you guys when US Fed doubled the supply of USD in 1 year printing relentlessly while other countries that depended on USD had no way to print any USD and had to bear the brunt of rampant inflation as they were hopelessly tied to USD? Of course you never bothered to find out the reality of whats going on in other countries that used USD while the Fed inflated it away. Now that he is trying something new to pivot away from BTC and its not even been a year into a long term project but you are ready to pass your judgements. Just a standard bunch of hypocrites. Nothing to see,5874,0.83,1664,2022-01-23 05:00:26

You guys understand that El Salvador wants $1.3 billion in funding from the IMF and that the IMF isnt just randomly asking them to drop BTC as a currency right?,Two posts are on the front page right now [El Salvador angrily rejects IMF call to drop Bitcoin use](https//np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/she2t3/el_salvador_angrily_rejects_imf_call_to_drop/) and [El Salvador Treasury Minister Alejandro Zelaya angrily rejects IMF demand to drop Bitcoin as legal tender We are a sovereign nation. No international organization is going to make us do anything anything at all!](https//np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/shs9au/el_salvador_treasury_minister_alejandro_zelaya/)You guys understand that the IMF isnt just randomly going around demanding stuff right? Most replies dont seem to understand that. El Salvador has tried to get [$1.3 billion in funding from them](https//www.reuters.com/article/us-el-salvador-economy-exclusive-idUSKBN2AW1GV) for almost a year now. Thats a ton of money. And sure edglord Bukele and his corrupt idiotic government can keep their stance that nobody can make them do anything - but nobody is trying to force them to do anything. Its more of a yeah we wont give you money as long as you are gambling with your economy in an irresponsible manner. Which is a completely reasonable attitude. Why would they just give money to them without conditions?El Salvador doesnt hold any power here. Theyre an irrelevant tiny economy the IMF couldnt care less about them. If they want money theyll have to comply. Or the dictator once again makes a stupid decision for his country...,5435,0.81,1548,2022-02-01 14:25:31
Here is how I doxxed the creator of a scamcoin and make him abandon the scam few minutes before launch,*I posted this yesterday but it was removed by reddit because I said the website of the scam. Now I repost it without any information so please dont ask for it. Anyway the website is now deleted so you cant see anything.* I own a telegram group where this morning an user entered telling everyone to be quick because today it was starting the private sale of a new coin.I looked at its website and it was clearly made by an amateur. Its whitepaper was a joke.However the devs officially doxxed themselves and most users in their official telegram group were starting to believe in this scam.I noticed some users were clearly fake saying things like I follow this project since 1 year and its amazing but I checked and the **group was created just few days ago so how they were following this project since 1 year ago?**I then decided to **contact on LinkedIn the 2 official admins of the project**. They both answered me that they had nothing to do with it and clearly someone took their names and photos and posted them on that website.45 minutes were remaining before the private sale would start. By the way the private sale was going to work in this way they would publish a bsc address and everyone had to send bnb at that address. In exchange they would receive back 2000 of these new tokens.I posted in their group that admins were liars and that the people listed in the official website were not related to this project in any way.They accused me of fud I had no proofs. Also they were deleting most of my messages. **Then I tried what I thought was impossible because only the worst amateur would make such a mistake I did a whois of the domain of their website** and found out the website was created just 2 days ago and I found the name and the address of the owner. This guy didnt even think to hide it properly.**At this point it was just few minutes before the official launch of the private sale. I simply posted in the group the name and the home address of the scammer and then if anyone will be scammed just give this name to the police**Admins abandoned the group immediately countdown went to 0 but no private sale started. They literally disappeared and they had no opportunity to scam anyone.Obviously they were amateurs its harder with professional scammers but Im proud that I destroyed the plan of these scammers who invested money and time in creating their website and preparing this scam.,5410,0.93,815,2022-02-08 06:55:55

Cardano network clogged Avalanche congested a while ago Polygon almost stopped completely due to some flower picking game. Are these really going to work as an alternative to Ethereum with its high gas fees?, Before anyone goes nuclear I will say that ETH is too damn expensive. But are the alternatives really so much better? Recent news about Cardano congestion shooting up around 90% and more Polygon being borderline unresponsive during Sunflower popularity/incident and AVAX fees getting sky high while network suffered congestion a few months ago.If these networks had the Ethereum levels of activitynon them they wouldnt hold for long. Cardano has a handful of dapps and its already clogged? Same with Polygon. 1 dapp putting whole network on stop is really not what people would expect of the so called next gen eth competitors.While I 100% agree that gas fees on Ethereum are absurd I wonder if the alternatives that we have at the moment in top10 are going to solve that. All claim insane TPS and finality times but when the shit gets real the fees and network congestion go up to the sky.,4604,0.87,3005,2022-01-27 16:14:15
The mass adoption wont happen until Apple of crypto comes along.,Its pretty simple really. To get mass adoption to the levels we want we need an iPhone style event into the market by some massive and already well-established company. Sure LG and other companies made touch screen phones before Apple did but Apple did it better and they made it much more simple to use. Theyve dumbed down the whole thing so even half-trained monkey could do it.This is what we need in crypto. Right now all we have is a crap-ton of different chains bridges multiple ecosystems multiple wallets etc. its just too much for the average Joe. Heck even for myself it was truly difficult to sell one coin the other day (not gonna shill here any names). It took me around 12 different steps moving between bridges converters and so on etc. before I was finally able to cash it out to FIAT without destroying myself with high fees to make it worthwhile. Sure I could just cash out via traditional methods but Id lose like 15% of my coins doing that. This stuff should be automated a long time ago.But this will take time a lot of time. The true adoption will start when we are allowed to just add crypto to our Google Pay or Apple Pay by scanning a quick QR code from our crypto wallet without thinking two secs or giving a single fuck if our coins are going to disappear because weve mistyped one or two letters in the wallet. Or because your wallet supports coins X Y Z but not coins A B C. Until then mass adoption is just an empty slogan that wont happen for another 10 years or more.Edit Reddit gold?!

The $320m Wormhole hack was replenished by Jump Capital an institutional trading desk/market maker (similar to Citadel) without any questions. This shows the entire Solana ecosystem is just a sham propped up by institutional entities,Yesterday the Wormhole bridge one of Solanas biggest bridges lost $320m in a hack. Within hours a trading desk Jump Capital agreed to replenish the entire amount so that the liquidations calamity is avoided. The loss of the peg due to the hack could have sent the network into cascading liquidations arising out of leveraged positions. In stepped a VC to save the day.[Lost $320m? Thats fine.. we got you covered. ](https//preview.redd.it/adhsxhuefqf81.jpg?width=1172&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7ed759f03c763a7cfd07d8bb35a03cff7aa3921d)The fact that VCs are ready to cover these kind of losses shows that the entire Solana ecosystem is just one big sham propped up by these same VCs. They dont want their baby to die just yet. Apparently Jump Capital owns a significant stake in Wormhole and is ready to sink such a huge amount to cover losses. In Solana the top 1.34% of addresses owns 99% of the circulating supply. Most of the supply was sold to early VCs and insiders at a massive discount to retail. Insiders and bad actors like Chamath have publicly joked about using Solana as a vehicle to play their pumps and dumps out leaving retail to hold the bags when the sham unfolds. VCs dont just sink in $300m to save the day unless they have already taken out 50x that amount - that is what Solana has enabled them to do already.So a buncha SOL Shills be like hurr durr even ehtirium had hacks and was saved by fork. Well the DAO hack was solved by cryptography solutions (forking) not by VCs stepping into save the day. If you think both are the same you clearly understand NOTHING about crypto whatsoever. The DAO hack and the hard fork took over a month to assess propose solutions and resolve. It wasnt an overnight fix like what solana is known for. When Solana goes down - over night fix.When bridge hacked? - overnight fix. How long will Solana depend on overnight fixes to bail the network out?Edit The mental gymnastics of SOlshills is just incredible. They have clearly consumed all the kool aid in the world to be supportive of this kind of institution manipulation. Yes other projects also have VCs and Eth projects have also been hacked. Yet none of the ETH projects have been bailed out in this manner by VCs and institutions. I have been extremely critical of ETH too. There is virtually a hack a day on Eth due to poor code or implementation or bugs but none of the ETH project hacks have been replenished by institutions. If an ETH projects gets hacked and people lose money well you are shit out of luck. As evidenced by hundreds of hacks and scams before. The first major Solana hack and less than 24 hours later the institutions propping up solana claim they are bailing everyone out. If this is not the least bit suspicious to you then you are just being slow boiled alive. Solana itself is a long term pump and dump that is devoid of any decentralisation and fundamentals except a bunch of whales propping it up. The tokenomics of every single Solana ecosystem project is puke worthy - from Serum to Raydium Bonfida Saber etc all have massive supply in the hands of a few an incredibly high FDV and a low float and funny unlock mechanisms - perfect conditions for institutions to keep dumping on hapless retail investors like the ones supporting Solana in the comments here who dont understand anything about crypto or finance.,4499,0.86,1382,2022-02-04 03:17:30
Escorts are one of the main reasons why cryptocurrency blew up,In 2015 credit card companies stopped processing transactions for escort listing websites with backpage being the main one. I owned & operated an escort agency at the time and I did most of the marketing myself. At first the websites were letting us post for free but after a while they started charging again. BTC was the only form of payment these websites could accept. This was the first major boom in functional transactions. Suddenly thousands of people are buying hundreds of thousands worth of BTC on a daily basis to post these ads with. Check the ledgers and youll see all of the action. This was the first time that the concept was proved on a major scale. BTC and crypto in general would not be as big of a thing without all of the escorts who pushed it along through facilitating millions of dollars in transactions.Just a little inside history for anybody who didnt know these things. I feel as if most people dont,4292,0.88,949,2022-01-29 15:08:41

Firstly one man can indirectly control the markets without even meaning to (at least he didnt mean to in this case). Secondly it is projects like this that makes the average retail investor think that crypto is a pyramid scheme/scam. As an asset class crypto needs to move away from these sort of projects and focus on fundamentals etc. Tl;dr Hitler Inu token is up over 5500% based off an average meme.,4282,0.8,1792,2022-01-31 07:46:00

Lets have a look**https//preview.redd.it/0us34zsk3jd81.png?width=2108&format=png&auto=webp&s=79de6ff34018315c748a2e743caef0ca3b277c65**There was no bear market. There was a relatively small crash in 2020 as everyone panicked over Covid. Thats not a bear market. This picture also shows you that its even worse the market has been absolutely parabolic for almost 2 years.** Thats the S&P 500 index. Notice something? Every ten years or so theres a severe downward correction which lasts 1-2 years. In the early 2000s it was the tech bubble in 2008/9 it was the mortgage crisis. As you can see here weve been in a sharp uptrend for over 10 years now. This uptrend has been fueled not in small part by record low interest rates. This is turn has resulted in parts of the market being hopelessly overvalued a prime example being Tesla.Now look at the crypto charts specifically the top 50 alts. Most of them have had absolutely face melting pumps over the last 18 months. Do you think thats just going to keep going up? Their valuations are now so ridiculous that crypto market caps are basically a meme completely detached from reality. Of course market caps are hardly ever a true reflection of what company is worth but they are a reflection of the amount of speculation in the current market. Just to look at a fewCardano MC $36 billion doesnt have fully functional smart contracts lots of promises while continually underdelivering if at all.Solana MC $30 billion has been unusable for the last 48 hours has suffered multiple outages over the last 6 months which lasted up to 17 hours.Dogecoin $18 billion MC....dont think I need to go into more detail on this one.Ethereum $288 billion market cap supposed to disrupt the global banking industry (along with everything else) meanwhile it costs $200 for a simple ERC20 token swap.BTC $665 billion market cap supposed to be the future of digital store of value meanwhile has lost more than 50% in value over the course of 2.5 months.etc....The point is that these market caps arent a reflection of the current states of those projects but rather their promised states at some future point in time. Unless that point in time is very close as in a few months away thats not sustainable. I personally dont think that point in time is very close as almost nothing in crypto currency works as advertised.**What would a multi year global bear market mean for crypto?**- BTC bleeds more than stock market- ETH bleeds more than BTC- Alts will bleed even heavier than ETH and a good number will never recover. You have to remember something very basic here if an alt your holding loses 90% of its value in the bear market it has to pull a 10X just to get back to its previous price.**Further complication**DCAing into projects is obviously the way to go in a bear market but it becomes more difficult to predict what projects will have merit the longer the bear market continues. Will your favourite project still be relevant in 2024 or will it be replaced by something that hasnt even launched and wont until 2023? The longer the bear market lasts the more likely that outcome becomes. Do lots of research try to keep up with the tech developments in crypto. The next Solana or Luna is probably being planned as I write this. Try to find it.,4269,0.85,2021,2022-01-23 22:06:12
Crypto.com introduces Worldwide Account Protection Programme protects victims of unauthorised transactions of up to USD$250000,Just read the security report from Crypto.com in an official press release issued barely 3 days after the recent hacking.I think this is impressive not just for CDC but for the crypto market in general in building confidence in cryptocurrency. This is so vital considering how crypto is still held in suspicion by many.To quote them>Crypto.com is introducing the Worldwide Account Protection Program (WAPP). WAPP offers additional protection and security for user funds held in the Crypto.com App and the Crypto.com Exchange.  >  >WAPP is designed to protect user funds in cases where a third party gains unauthorized access to their account and withdraws funds without the users permission. WAPP restores funds up to USD$250000 for qualified users; terms & conditions apply.Some noteworthy things you must do to qualify for the WAPP* Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on all transaction types where MFA is currently available * Set up an anti-phishing code at least 21 days prior to the reported unauthorized transaction* Not be using jailbroken devices * File a police report and provide a copy of it to Crypto.com; and * Complete a questionnaire to support a forensic investigation.The WAPP will begin rolling out in select markets starting 1 February 2022. CDC has also 1. migrated to a new 2FA infrastructure with a longer term plan to migrate  to true Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).2. Introduced an additional layer of security on 18 Jan to add a mandatory 24-hour delay between registration of a new whitelisted withdrawal address and first withdrawal.3. Full audit of the entire infrastructure4. Engaged with third-party security firms to perform additional security checks + threat intelligence5. And of course all affected customers have been fully reimbursed.[Heres the link to the report.](https//crypto.com/product-news/crypto-com-security-report-next-steps)EDIT Sincere thanks for the awards!  EDIT2 I really didnt expect this to blow up. Thank you all for the awards! I just want to add that yes I am a CDC customer but I also hold many other tokens and coins and Im well aware of the amount of suspicion and misunderstanding many people have regarding crypto. Its really important that as time passes the crypto world shows that it cares it is relatable and it adds value. Thats why I decided to share about this. I am also learning that other exchanges offer similar - but maybe its not marketed as well. Marketing is awareness. And its true that the way a service provider reacts to a crisis is key to its public perception. thanks for reading!,4189,0.91,1701,2022-01-20 08:32:39
Taxes,Taxes suck we all know that. Here is my pro tip for all of you. I made lots of trades lots. Not only did I do that I used mutiple exchanges and even more wallets. So my transaction count is quite high. Here is the real bear though. When you sit here and import everything into your coin tracker of choice (Koinly here) everything may not be there. I spent the last two days trying different platforms and importing APIs. Nothing seemed to work. Thankfully I keep records of everything and was able link everything up manually over about six hours. Needless to say dont be me. Being more of a minimalist when it comes to exchanges and wallets is by far the way to go. Lastly Fuck Uncle Sam and capital gains…,4069,0.86,1430,2022-01-18 01:48:37
Why is everyone so sure that crypto will always bounce back strong at some point?,This isnt fud or anything.  I actually have most of my money in crypto so I make posts like these somewhat in part for my own sanity too and the discussions on these topics.I notice a lot of smart people who analyze the market seem to think theres always a strong likelihood of reaching new highs in the future. IE- the market may go down a lot and reach bear markets but somehow it will bounce back and eventually reach new all time highs at some point for bitcoin etherium and others.

Ripple is funding propaganda against Bitcoin by teaming up with the government to spread energy FUD,Ripple labs has been funding research along with government entities to spread propaganda against Bitcoin and mining.

The same Department of Treasury headed by another well known Bitcoin hater Janet Yellen who earned $7m as speaking fee from the same banks she is supposed to regulate but has tried to stifle Bitcoin and crypto at every opportunity. Research with financial support is nothing but propaganda especially when its funded by a competitor to bitcoin that lobbies with the government.

As usual they will fail. The narrative that bitcoin mining companies cause increase in electricity bills in NY is rubbish as the largest BTC mining companies in New York produce their own energy. Infact the last one to start mining in NY is a hydro electric plant that was unused for years before they started mining Bitcoin last year.

Nothing to see here.Final Edit Jjust look at the number of freshly created Tin accounts that have popped up in the comments to shill for XRP. Didnt realize 2017 left so many bag holders. It must be real miserable with these heavy bags that are at 1/3rd of their 2017 ATH while almost every other coin has gone up hundreds of % and made new highs this cycle. Thats what happens when you become exit liquidity for mccaleb garlinghouse etc. Lol at the shills shouting REEE ripple is a company XRP is decentralised token. They really did you good with this one small trick. Thats also the reason garlinhouse drives a shiny car while you are down 50% on your shitcoin investment. The D in XRP stands for decentralised. It was always a premined scam token and will always be one. Thousands of tin bagholders wont change this.,3885,0.7,2715,2022-01-15 22:15:00
Doge has a single wallet with more than 23.17% of all the Dogecoin in circulation and it can be rugpulled at ANY moment.,For comparison the largest Bitcoin wallet is the Binance coldwallet and it holds approximately 1.40% of the current circulating supply while the largest Ethereum wallet is the  Eth2 Deposit Contract which holds 7.6% of all Ethereum.The largest Dogecoin wallet which currently holds $5 Billion in Doge of its $21 Billion market cap is very mysterious. It was thought to be Robinhood or some other exchange but that has previously been dismissed by the Robinhood CEO himself.[Doge wallet with 23.17&#37; of the entire circulating supply](https//preview.redd.it/go0edwi8nic81.png?width=1436&format=png&auto=webp&s=67d99e6b36c56bcf24470f6676421f98dee70f4f)Any wallet that holds over 23.17% of the current supply has more than enough to rug pull an entire coin to near zero. Even half of that can cause the price to crash to unrecoverable levels due to how liquidity and market caps work.According to Forkast>For new cryptocurrencies if the top 10 wallets hold **more than 20% of the** token or worse a large percentage of the token is held in a single wallet then this is a dangerous sign of a potential rug pull.**For Doge the top 14 wallets own  46.11% of all Dogecoin.**TLDR Avoid any Cryptocurrency that has wallets capable of rug pulling the entire project. Dont let a false sense of security take over just because Doge is popular. It still does not make Doge immune to rugpulls. Never let yourself be at the mercy of a single wallet.EDIT The amount of people on the comments claiming it to be the Robinhood wallet DESPITE Robinhoods CEO publicly stating the company does not hold that much Doge as far back as May is the same argument Shib shillers make. It is careless copium. [https//www.marketwatch.com/story/a-25-billion-dogecoin-whale-lurks-but-robinhood-ceo-says-we-dont-have-significant-positions-in-any-of-the-coins-we-keep-11620326508](https//www.marketwatch.com/story/a-25-billion-dogecoin-whale-lurks-but-robinhood-ceo-says-we-dont-have-significant-positions-in-any-of-the-coins-we-keep-11620326508) Moreover the fact that some people find safety in a company like Robinhood is just stupid. ,3837,0.74,2453,2022-01-18 22:03:51
US Congress Yet another Omnibus Bill has been introduced in Congress that contains provisions that seeks to prohibit crypto transactions damage privacy and constitutional rights. Once again we have to fight these laws.,After the Infrastructure bill debacle where anti-crypto laws were introduced in a must pass bill now a new America COMPETES act has just been filed in Congress. This Bill on the surface seeks to make US more competitive against China. But hidden deep in its 2900 pages this Bill contains provisions that give the Treasury unlimited powers to prohibit and block crypto exchanges. Currently the Treasury cannot take unilateral decisions to block crypto transactions without a formal notice and a public process and give a 120 day period to challenge any decision. However under the new Bill the Treasury can take decisions without any formal process based solely on its own apprehensions. The new bill allows the Treasury headed by Yellen to block transmission of funds if the Treasury deems so. It can quickly order blocking any transaction or exchange without any review process or administrative controls. This gives the Treasury unchecked control over all crypto exchanges and transactions. This language was already included in a bill from last year however there was opposition and it was removed. However yet again this has been sneaked into a must pass bill. The very idea of sneaking in such clauses in 2900 pages of incomprehensible regulations stinks. How are even the legislators going to read any of this?

Interest in Shiba Inu seems to have dried up completely,A few months ago the meme-coin Shiba Inu (SHIB) was pretty much in the spotlight. The cryptocurrency rose astronomically within a short period of time and crypto investors interest in the project was gigantic at times. Shiba Inu even made it into the top 10 largest cryptocurrencies. However the price of Shiba Inu has since plummeted and the hype and interest surrounding the project seems to have completely evaporated as well.&#x200B;**Google Trends**In fact last year Shiba Inu was so popular that it topped CoinMarketCap in terms of searches. Also on the Google there was a huge search for for example Shiba Inu or Buy Shiba Inu all over the world.&#x200B;However this search volume on Google has totally dried up in the last 90 days. Google Trends shows that a peak in terms of interest was reached on October 29 last year. Since then this search volume has plummeted by a whopping 92%!&#x200B;https//preview.redd.it/9lts5dtmyve81.png?width=1168&format=png&auto=webp&s=e667ddbf9ad93d831e1f3d6f02d518bcc574f8c3**Shiba Inu Price**The price of meme-coin did not manage to perform much better in recent months. Since the all-time high set at the end of October 2021 the SHIB price has dropped more than 75%.  In fact at the beginning of January Shiba Inus market capitalization plummeted by more than $3.5 billion in just one week.&#x200B;Although the team at Shiba Inu is still working hard behind the scenes to get the project back on track this seems to have become quite a task. Here and there SHIB still gets listed on a new crypto exchange but the extreme price appreciation we saw in the past seems to be a thing of the past so far.&#x200B;Of course Shiba Inu is not the only cryptocurrency that is performing poorly at the moment. Due to the high uncertainty in both the crypto and equity markets most cryptocurrencies are deep in the red. Nevertheless the demise of SHIB can be called an outlier.&#x200B;&#x200B;Edit Shib holders and fans stop attacking me for pointing out your coin has had its day and people have moved to the next Doge/Shib jeez chillax and accept the bad investment choices you made,3722,0.79,2706,2022-01-30 20:36:00

I hate to say it but a lot of the newer Crypto investors arent investing but rather gambling.,Most newbies think that Crypto is something that will make you rich overnight and they end up investing in low market cap coins before they moon. Of course a few of them might have the potential to give you great returns but a lot of people completely end up ignoring the risk factor. # CryptoMoonShots vs r/Cryptocurrencyhttps//preview.redd.it/azvhoo2o3nb81.png?width=1099&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6668d709c5ff7f2f82bd1a4ef1ce276700af48dThe CryptoMoonShots subreddit has even started to outpace the Cryptocurrency subreddit in terms of growth. It is a terrible thing to see considering the vast majority of the cryptocurrencies advertised there there are complete scam projects. Dont get me wrong. Some low market coins do have great utility and great future potential but when you start going lower into the low millions or hundreds of thousands the risk far outweighs their benefits.If you are new to Crypto the best thing you can do in Crypto is DCA and accumulate larger projects for the long term. Crypto is not the stock market and deviating away from trusted projects or trying to rely on technical analysis is very risky.TLDR Unfortunately a lot of the newbies that are joining Crypto are completely ignoring even top 100 coins and are choosing to put their money in these shady get rich quick schemes which is nothing short of gambling.,3523,0.84,2171,2022-01-14 12:02:17
I took this subs advice today and it was the worst decision I have ever made.,With everything being in the red this week I started listening to all the post that said take a break and enjoy life stop looking at the charts and go outside.Thats when I made the worst mistake of my life I Listened to people on r/CryptoCurrency.I put the phone down and looked around only to see the very thing Ive been hiding from my entire life bills debt crippling depression no social skills the inability to relate to others and worst of all being poor.# Being poor sucks.* I checked the mail and apparently I owe a lot of money to different companies for things like electricity and water.* I looked at my real wallet and its even emptier than my crypto wallet.* I screamed ALGO!!! at the store and people didnt applaud me or start saying if you go Ill ALGO* I told the cashier that FIAT is poison and she should accept bitcoin but she just stared at me and told me not to worry about paying but that I wasnt allowed to return.* after a difficult day I pulled out my Ace and said Moons to $1.00 but was only met with stares.so the moral of the story is dont listen to people on this sub the real world sucks and they dont even have gifs.&#x200B;TLDR its not all sunshine and rainbows out in the world so keep looking at the charts and shitposting.,3373,0.88,660,2022-01-21 20:03:27

People who say dont keep your coins on exchanges are like old people who lived through the Great Depression not trusting banks,In the early days of crypto it made perfect sense not to trust exchanges. Most exchanges were run by weebs out of their parents basements. Mt. Goxx wiped out a whole generation of potential crypto millionaires. There were no adults in the room.These days there are reputable exchanges available. Coinbase isnt going to exit scam when theyre publicly traded on the NASDAQ. You might get into trouble if youre trading with 1000X leverage on Bitmex or buying AssCoin on Cryptopia2 but you can assess your own level of risk.Were at the point where you hear way more stories about people getting robbed holding their own keys than you do losing their coins on exchanges. How much of this is user error? Probably most of it but most people arent experts. Telling crypto beginners to get their coins off of exchanges ASAP is a great way to get them to lose it all and swear of crypto forever. I know crypto folks like to gatekeep and clown on people losing their coins in stupid ways but if the dream is mass adoption its not going to happen if its inaccessible to normies and hazardous to use. Reputable exchanges are the best case scenario for 90% of the population owning crypto.In 2021 theres nothing wrong with keeping your coins on an exchange if its a reputable one. I get the whole freedom angle but freedom comes with risks that most people arent ready for.,3302,0.67,2481,2022-01-29 01:14:21

Fidelity is one of the largest asset managers in the world with $4.9 trillion in assets under management. They wrote this,>We also think there is very high stakes game theory at play here whereby if bitcoin adoption increases the countries that secure some bitcoin today will be better off competitively than their peers. Therefore even if other countries do not believe in the investment thesis or adoption of bitcoin they will be forced to acquire some as a form of insurance. In other words a small cost can be paid today as a hedge compared to a potentially much larger cost years in the future. **We therefore wouldnt be surprised to see other sovereign nation states acquire bitcoin in 2022 and perhaps even see a central bank make an acquisition.**Source [https//www.fidelitydigitalassets.com/articles/2021-trends-impact](https//www.fidelitydigitalassets.com/articles/2021-trends-impact),3249,0.95,787,2022-01-14 01:51:24

Bitcoin was supposed to be the solution to BIG MONEY. Now it instantly dips everytime when the stock market dips.,To be honest this makes me sad.As far as I remember Bitcoin was thought to be the solution of the fact that institutions wall street and big money control the financial world and the pennies of the simple people from the normal population. And it was more or less like this in the first several years after the inception of Bitcoin. We saw so much price discovery Bitcoin being volatile because mere mortals like us were buying hodling selling wondering how much the *real* price of this asset is. It was literally supply and demand controlled only by the psychology and the individual decisions of every single one of us.What do we see nowadays? We go to bed we wake up and we see that Bitcoin is at -10% for no reason. Literally for no reason. Neither me or you have sold. We were just sleeping. What happens? Bitcoin is strongly tied to the trading algorithms of insitutions and they handle it the same way they handle stocks. If the stock market is supposed to move down bitcoin and crypto in general follows instantly in a nanosecond. We are not in control anymore. It doesnt matter if we buy or sell.During the last few years we welcomed institutional interest and we cheered. Now I realize that they have much more power than us and the situation is the same as it has ever been - big money controls the pennies or in this case the satoshis of us - the simple people.It makes me sad but in the end this is an open and free market. Everybody has the right to buy sell or hold as much as he or she wants. In this case it just happens so that the big players choose to be massively invested in crypto which gives us the spot on the sidelines - sit and observe how the price fluctuates without being able to react on our own.EDIT I agree with a lot of you guys and girls. The same way sometimes we go to bed wake up and see that Bitcoin is +15%. In those green days nobody complains about it. What concerns me in overall is how tied the price movement of crypto assets to the price movement traditional assets is. I am not sure if this is an issue to be concerned about. However its a fact and I feel the necessity to talk about it and discuss its impact.EDIT 2 wow thanks for the amazing discussion! I appreciate that so many people participate in it and share their view on the topic.,3061,0.89,1281,2022-01-21 10:41:26
One of the biggest audit firm in Canada just bought BTC and ETH for the first time saying that cryptoassets are a maturing asset class. Institutions are getting onboard!,One of the most bullish things for our ecosystem will be the adoption of crypto by large institutions. And today one of Canadas largest auditing and verification firms announced that they have purchased BTC and ETH for the first time ever!The firm KPMG is a major player in Canada. Its been around for more than 150 years and employs nearly 8000 people. Heres what they had to say  Investors such as hedge funds and family offices to large insurers and pension funds **are increasingly gaining exposure to cryptoassets** (...). This investment reflects our belief that **institutional adoption of cryptoassets and blockchain technology will continue to grow** and become a regular part of the asset mix. For me this news is absolutely a bullish sign. No matter what the haters and no-coiners think crypto is here to stay and this kind of news proves it. Institutions have only just set foot in it we are still very early! Just think about it  if you hold long enough you will probably end up selling your tokens to Wall Street big boys in a few years. We are indeed all gonna make it.,3052,0.92,625,2022-02-07 16:52:56

Tesla will NOT be accepting DOGE.... thats the reality and to pretend that being able to buy some toys or a belt buckle (835 DOGE) in the Tesla Store is the same thing as actual adoption is disingenuous at best.

Fed has too much power over crypto and that was not suppose to happen,Ive been thinking about this lately.Crypto was supposed to be decentralized so it would not have a single entity controlling it. We would not be bond to the whims of a single centralized government or private entity.And as of late ive seen crypto being controlled by the fed. They say they will print more crypto pumps they say they will print less crypto dumps. This is the same as the stock market and its a shame because it defeats the sole porpuse of decentralization.If you think the fed will ever fight inflation think again&#x200B;https//preview.redd.it/ypt6qrxr98b81.png?width=770&format=png&auto=webp&s=d53e7d664544a3fa7e501f82d9926a49029626551921- In the 19th century deflationary periods were the result of an increase in production rather than a decrease in demand. During the Great Depression deflation was the result of **a collapsing financial sector and bank failures**. Demand is higher and production is slower theres news everywhere of cars unable to be sold because they lack chips.This pandemic hit most supply chains everywhere and thats until its normalized there will be more demand for some products than actual production.Maybe in a couple of years while normalizing the supply chain we will actually produce more than demand requires and it will be 1921 all over again....&#x200B;1930 -  During the Great Depression deflation was the **result of a collapsing financial sector and bank failures**. The deflation that took place at the outset of the Great Depression was the most dramatic that the U.S. has ever experienced. Prices dropped an average of ten percent every year between the years of 1930 and 1933. Prices drop 10% a year is something that wont stimulate the economy ask yourself why would you buy a car worth 10k when next year it will be 9k or a house. People would spend much less because saving was making them money.This is something the economy cant afford right now many companies are barely surviving and the least they need is people to be willing to spend less money because they dont want to spend their savings which are increasing in value.Crypto should be an edge against inflation which is rampant and most likely never tackled with printing is done theres no way they will reverse course.No matter what the fed says I doubt they will actually go for deflationary policy. They might print less.Look at Obamas term he started with 2008 crash the housing crash!!!8 years of Obamas term with good economy and yet the fed didnt increase rates. Only when Trump became president did they started increasing.So if we take into account the same we still have 6 years left of Joe Biden with covid crisis if he lives that long. with no rate hike.&#x200B;Resume Crypto will always be an edge against inflation which will never be tackled No matter what the fed says crypto should do its own thing.I fear more rampant inflation and the hit on my savings than a crypto crash because crypto proved to me it can recover and my savings are still worth less and less.,2479,0.8,2010,2022-01-12 10:01:18
The truth is Crypto prices will go even more down.,This crash is triggered by many factors. Bitcoin is already at 35k$.We are yet to see Feds increasing the interest rates which they have to increase to curb the inflationPrediction is that this decision will come by march so during Feb to March the chances that crypto prices will increase during this time is negligible. Now imagine cryto prices declining(Or being stable) till march and then feds will decide to increase the interest rate. Imagine the amount of panic selling that would be there.Also when interest rates will be increased there would be less money in circulation so naturally less people will invest in crypto so it will go even more downI am scared to say this that it may reach 20k$ or even less. Then only it can go up,2419,0.81,2778,2022-01-22 07:29:51
The Solana network is rekt and unusable. The sub is a havoc,The Solana network is totally congested and unusable in anyway right now. When people try send coins out of the wallet it gives 404 error lmao. Tryna undtake some coins? Transaction fails. Explorer says 404 error. Some people still wanna take some risk and add collateral and the transactions arent going through. Its basically an offline blockchain rn. This used to be discussed on the Solana sub few times and used to be called out as FUD. The same shit is getting agreed now. I used to hear shit like decentralisation is not the only important aspect network can be usable and also centralised and be successful. **decentralisation IS important**The bots are spamming w micro transactions because theyre basically free.

As someone whos not from the USA you all politicize crypto way too much.,We get it.

No. There are so many of us that dont give an absolute donkeys ass about why you think one party is better than the other. They are both awful and youre kidding yourself if you think **either** of them has you or your favourite cryptos best interest in mind.By all means it is important that many of these topics within the political sphere are discussed and opposed when they threaten the future of our financial independence freedom of information etc.But really it gets old fast when you all inject your political views into things. If youre going to constantly look for reasons to hate on a political party  but not actually address the underlying REASONS both parties are equally corrupt when discussing crypto youre not helping the issue youre *part* of it./rant*Edit since this blew up way more than I expected*Yes I recognize crypto in its nature is somewhat political since its tied to money and ultimately affected by monetary policy. Im not saying dont talk about it.My point was that it gets old when people use every little thing in the crypto space as a means to support and reaffirm their political bias for one party or another when its clear they are *both* paid for by the very same people who likely dont want crypto to happen.,2356,0.88,1186,2022-01-28 03:25:54

I will compare my homemade 2022 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment to a Total Crypto Market Cap Index Token ($TCAP [r/TotalCryptoMarketCap](https//np.reddit.com/r/TotalCryptoMarketCap/)) to see which one outperforms.Here we go ## Two Year Report – UP 795%📷The 2020 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund consists of **BTC ETH XRP USDT BCH Litecoin EOS BNB BSV** and **Tezos**.  December highlights for the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio * All 2020 Top Ten cryptos down by double digits.* After two years the 2020 Portfolio is +795%.* The 2020 Top Ten Crypto Portfolio retains the title of best performing of all four Top Ten Experiments.This group of cryptos highlights the benefits of an index fund strategy the **+795%** return of the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio has *outperformed eight of the individual component cryptos contained within the Index.* Only by guessing right and throwing all your eggs into **Ethereum** and/or **Binance Coin** would you have performed better than spreading out the risk index style.  ## December Ranking and Dropout Reporthttps//preview.redd.it/x2oovjv0ctd81.png?width=1053&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d2b242db061c612e3a1a3aedeea1f424907ecd8**Top Ten dropouts since January 2020**  after two years half of the cryptos that [started in the Top Ten](https//toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2020-top-ten-month-one/) have dropped out  **EOS** **BSV Tezos Litecoin** and **Bitcoin Cash** have been replaced by **Cardano** **Polkadot Solana Luna** and **USDC.**At #61 **BSV** has sunk the lowest since January 2020.## December Winners and Losers ***December Winners*** – no winners this month besides stablecoin **USDT** all cryptos in this portfolio lost value.***December Losers*** –  **Litecoin** fell -30% this month followed by the second worst performing crypto **EOS** down -24% in December. ## Tally of Monthly Winners and LosersAfter two years heres a snapshot of the 2020 Top Ten Experiments monthly winners and losers With six monthly victories **ETH** leads the pack.  **Tether** still has the most monthly losses a good sign for the 2020 Top Ten Portfolio.## Two Year Update – BNB victorious followed by second place ETH.

What I like to call the worlds slowest dollar cost averaging method?  Here are the figures* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st 2018 = $1780 today* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st 2019 = $1900 today* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st 2020 = $1480 today* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st 2021 = $1270 todayTaken together heres the bottom bottom bottom *bottom* line for a similar approach with the S&P **After four $1000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018 2019 2020 and 2021 my portfolio would be worth $6430** ($1780 + $1900 + $1480 + $1270).That is up **+61%** [since January 2018](https//toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+406%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.To help provide perspective heres a quick look at the combined four year ROI for the Top Ten cryptos vs. the S&P up to this point.https//preview.redd.it/w08673hgctd81.png?width=575&format=png&auto=webp&s=b651956ce75d1a4a54ef4a35484dab4788ff0071## ConclusionFor those who have supported the Experiments over the years thank you.  For those just getting into crypto I hope these monthly reports can somehow help with perspective as you embark on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up think long term dont invest what you cant afford to lose and most importantly try to enjoy the ride!Feel free to reach out with any questions and stay tuned for progress reports.

I will never trust any of you cowards ever again!,I trusted all of you. You said you would HODL.&#x200B;Instead you SODL.Your bloodlines will be forgotten in history. The gene pool will weed you out as inadequate. The future generations you unfortunately spawn while they last will be poor and dumb.Is that what you want for your children and their children? Poor and dumb? Too bad thats what theyre going to be. All because you sold during the bear market in a moment of weakness.We were brothers and sisters in arms. A valiant group of individuals hellbent on changing the world. It turns out there are only a few of us with true strength both mentally and physically. Weve been stabbed in the back by short sighted individuals who are scared easily into selling at a loss.Take this as a call to arms. A wake-up call. I am insisting that you all HODL. We will defeat the bears and feast on their flesh and blood on a glorious round table with the finest mutton mead and life changing profits. Our future generations will be smart rich and attractive.We will become stronger than ever if only you have the courage.HODL.,2270,0.83,1113,2022-01-22 14:40:57
Gamers arent against NFTs. Theyre against microtransactions cash-grabs.,Last year several gaming studios announced plans to roll-out NFTs on their platforms and the backlash was swift. Gamers threatened to cancel their Discord membership Square Enix got criticized for introducing NFTs in *Kingdom Hearts* Ubisoft got panned for a similar NFT program last month...At first I was aghast. Why would gamers reject so violently a new technology? I am not a gamer myself so it was troubling.But I read about it and I came to this conclusion  gamers are not against to NFTs they are against microtransactions cash-grabs. And to them non-fungible tokens are nothing more than another way for studios to make more money. But this will change.From what I read the gaming industry has been plagued by microtransactions for quite some time now. You pay $60 for a game and yet you need to fork out more money to buy clothes armor weapons etc. for your character. That pisses off players and rightly so. So when big studios such as Square Enix or Ubisoft announced plans to offer NFTs those same gamers are pissed off  they only see this technology as another form of microtransactions.(There are also energy consumption concerns but as most NFTs are build on Ethereum those concerns will evaporate in six months when it switch to proof-of-stake.)**Thats why I think that in the long-term NFTs will find a way into the gaming industry.** When/if big studios find ways to make it enticing for players the revolution will begin. The tech will mature the fears will fade away and our ecosystem will benefit from this.,2273,0.89,923,2022-01-17 13:51:55
El Salvador irresponsible for buying Bitcoin dips. Meanwhile US government sitting on $30 trillion debt that will never be paid back.,First lets get something right.El Salvador is not down 15 million on Bitcoin investment. Thats fake news. El Salvador will more than make up for it from mining.El Salvador is also not investing in Bitcoin. El Salvador is looking to leverage its rich natural geothermal energy resources to transition to a Bitcoin economy.Bitcoin city will be a circular economy where locally everything will be priced in sats. So you can shove your US dollars.The only people who care about dollar price going up and down are people still treating Bitcoin as an investment. Youre buying with the intention of selling at a higher price.Some of us have no plan to ever sell bitcoin. We have already moved on to a superior monetary system where no central authority can print money for free out of thin air which other people are forced to work for and pay taxes. Everybody must prove they worked for money.,2239,0.84,805,2022-01-22 20:27:05
With crypto down by 40% in the last 3 months if this isnt a bear market what is a bear market?,Im fairly new in the crypto world bought most of my portfolio at the ATH of November and Im now stuck with an ever shrinking crypto account. Im also new to investment in general so when I learned about bull and bear markets last year I thought I understood what they meant. Bull is when people are hopeful and numbers go up. Bear is when people are fearful and numbers go down. But people here keep saying we are not in a bear market. When the market goes down everyday for months what is it then?,2214,0.94,1852,2022-01-21 17:34:39
Fill your bags now! Last chance to get BTC over $40k!,Alright guys the time has come and the true crash is about to happen! With Bitcoin right at the $40k mark this will be the last time in the foreseeable future youll be able to buy it this high a price. Its time to go all-in and prove that you truly have diamond hands. So what is my strategy-1- early withdraw my 401k and invest it in BTC2- get as many personal loans as I can and use those to buy ETH above $3k3- go to the bank and get a reverse mortgage on my home With these 3 simple steps I can set myself up to show that I have diamond hands and believe in crypto. It will lead to wife-changing money as she will divorce me and I can focus purely on crypto. I am also going to pressure my family and friends to invest blindly into crypto. If they can survive the next 3 years if a crypto winter they will earn my respect. Buy high sell low. Not financial advice.,2203,0.83,906,2022-01-21 02:52:16
Fear and Greed index is now at I dont fucking care anymore,SoFear and Greed Index shows the rough idea of market sentiments at any given time. After tremendous rise in Crypto prices past year the index went to the levels of extreme greed then to extreme fear within few weeks. But after sharp fall in Crypto prices this monthi can see the index at a whole new level I. E. I dont fucking care anymoreThis would be the best description at present levels of prices I guess! When you stop caring it might calm your nerves a bit. Eventually the prices will rise not today not tomorrow but in longer duration of time they will.,2187,0.91,865,2022-01-27 09:11:49
Its pretty interesting when you get to the point where you wake up each day and lose or gain 10k+ or so.,It puts things into perspective. What even is money if it can come and go so easily? Crypto is so relentless in how volatile it is sometimes you wonder if youll wake up and be more successful than you ever could imagine.Does anyone else relate? I got back into this ages ago and Ive gotten so used to the market I dont even care when I see my money fluctuate that much. Im just like oh cool another day. I made 10k or lost 10k over night on a trade who cares.Its amazing that it can be like that I never thought I would see my income streams be that worthless but exciting at the same time. Its truly exciting but at the same time as of late Ive learned to check out since weve been on a downtrend. My main holdings are in alts so Im seeing more volatile movement Im really big on LUNA and AVAX- I think they are extremely promising projects I also love Ethereum for obvious reasons like Smart Contracts.I cant even imagine people who wake up each day and lose or gain 1 mil 5 mil... and to think its just perspective.,2161,0.91,809,2022-01-17 21:11:46
Solana is the McDonalds ice cream machine of the crypto world.,I tried to give this chain the benefit of the doubt multiple times yet it always seems to fail my expectations.Either its down cause its out of RAM got attacked by a DDOS or now it got hacked.Theres always something wrong with this chain.Honestly I feel like its one of the most overhyped projects on the market especially with other chains like Polygon being MUCH more consistent cheaper and faster.At least when Polygon gets DDOSed it doesnt come to a complete stop like Solana. In fact even with the attack Polygon still had one of the cheapest fees on the market.I honestly dont know why anyone would keep supporting and hyping this chain anymore…,2034,0.87,1043,2022-02-03 09:50:37
Warning Coin Bureaus YouTube channel has been hacked and the hackers have released a new video telling everyone to buy a new scam coin,Coin Bureaus new YouTube video titled One World Cryptocurrency is an obvious scam. Most of the comments on that video are probably bots. Its a 1 minute video and it just contains some slides on how to buy the new scam coin. Not sure if coin bureau is the only one affected by this hack. Guy has not provided an update yet but he will probably post something about it in his telegram channel or on his twitter account. Obviously the scam coin is on Binance Smart Chain who couldve seen that coming. This is as obvious of a scam as youre ever gonna get please dont buy it. &#x200B;https//preview.redd.it/qqtnmjfzpmd81.jpg?width=234&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eeb255dee9fcc6c8fcf562c1d07a5cadd3551f4eReasons why there is no way this was posted by the Coin Bureau team1.

Snoop Dogg NFTs will replace all ticketing, Benefits of NFT ticketing&#x200B;* **Preventing fake tickets and scams**  **Blockchain provides a single source of truth for both ticket holders and organizers. The transfer of NFTs from the initial sale to resale is stored on the blockchain immutably so that all parties can prove the tickets authenticity.**  **In cases where the resale of tickets is forbidden NFTs can be developed as non-transferrable not to be moved to another buyer physically.*** **Reduce costs**  **Costs associated with selling and minting NFTs are negligible as compared to the traditional ticketing system. You can get an unforgeable ticket for less production cost so that customers and organizers can validate the authenticity of every ticket on the chain and track the history of ownership.*** **Perpetual revenue**  **Since programmable NFTs can have built-in rules for merchandise content resales and royalty splits it means that the organizer can analyze profit sharing percentages for future resales or creative content on secondary markets and receive funds knowing they are unalterable within the NFTs coding.*** **New revenue opportunities**  **NFT-based tickets act as programmable money providing unlimited potential for new revenue opportunities. For example the resale of NFT tickets as collectibles using NFT tickets to provide food and drink deals and rewarding fans who have gathered many event tickets.** [How can NFT Ticketing disrupt the ticketing industry? ](https//www.leewayhertz.com/how-nft-ticketing-works/)&#x200B;**Snoop Dogg**&#x200B;https//preview.redd.it/ozxv6r97tpc81.png?width=316&format=png&auto=webp&s=472d497f71405ee1c384f89c7a7824cbba0508da[**https//twitter.com/CozomoMedici/status/1483882395996762115?s=20**](https//twitter.com/CozomoMedici/status/1483882395996762115?s=20)&#x200B;https//preview.redd.it/keyhoe6atpc81.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d707adb55296fc1688117174476ca16c231dfce[https//twitter.com/SnoopDogg/status/1440038460417474567?t=myBM6AupGHXwuiwQPGdkEw&s=19](https//twitter.com/SnoopDogg/status/1440038460417474567?t=myBM6AupGHXwuiwQPGdkEw&s=19),2003,0.93,758,2022-01-19 21:48:30

I just unsubscribed from r/Technology. Its incredible the amount of massively upvoted front-page anti-Bitcoin/crypto FUD posts all of them low quality unsubstantiated and full of falsehoods.,Why they hate Bitcoin/crypto so much. Is because their false beliefs about the chip shortage mistakenly blamed on POW is it because they feel bad for missing the train.Or maybe they are influenced by the MSM lies and false narratives about Bitcoin is bad for the environment or just a speculative bubble/pyramid/Ponzi scheme without doing any research or due diligence by themselves.Maybe its a social engineered manipulation by big actors on that sub.They are missing the big pictureWhy would I ever give up my Bitcoin for printed-to-infinity government coupons (IOUs)? > Neo what are you trying to tell me that I can trade my bitcoins for millions someday?> > > > [Morpheus No Neo.

Remember Nano this subs (former?) favorite coin? It left the top 200 for the first time since 2017 today,Remember Nano? That coin that really shot up from like $0.15 in November 2017 to $33 two months later? It even was in the top 20 for a bit. Well I suppose many people on here must have bought close to ATH back then because they always REALLY wanted it to go there again and talked about their love for it a lotUnfortunately it never did. It was hit HARD by the bear market of 2018ff. even went below $0.4. While it did quite well in the bullrun of 2021 it was one of those coins that stayed way below their 2017-2018 ATHs it got close to $15. Other than most other formerly huge coins that didnt reach a new ATH this bull run - stuff like XRP BCH EOS NEO DASH... - which dont get a lot of love on here Nano stayed a sub favorite I dont think any other coin outside the top 100 (except Moons) is mentioned this often.Speaking of the top 100 you can see how much this sub loves Nano if you read [this post](https//np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/og5u6m/its_official_nano_is_no_longer_among_the_top_100/) from last July when it left the top 100 - OP was at a loss for words how could a coin that was perfect Instant. Feeless. Green not be much higher? Many people agreed the post has over 5k upvotes. I would argue the post was a bit dramatic - Nano hat only re-entered the top 100 3 months earlier after spending a few weeks below that - but you see how much love there is for the coin.Today it left the top 200 for the first time since its big explosion in late 2017 as I am writing this its 202 on Coingecko -91% since ATH the downtrend has been pretty consistent the past few months.What do you think about Nano? Do you still believe in it do you think it will break its ATH ever again? Do you think its a dead coin that will just continue to go down? Other coins have been declared dead for less but hey its crypto anything can happen,1852,0.96,1789,2022-01-15 11:48:37

As a young adult I view crypto as one of the only ways to potentially own a house/property in the future.,I just turned 21 a week ago today. Ive been investing in crypto for just about a year now but more seriously the past 7 or so months. No Im not investing significantly large amounts of money but I am allocating a fair percentage of my income into crypto. Why?Because buying a house owning some property or even renting a place has seen prices increase substantially; especially here in Canada where housing prices jumped over 26% last year. Im not investing on a whim; I take the time to learn the fundamentals and do my research. I buy solid crypto that I personally believe in for the long term. Im fine waiting practicing patience and accumulating over time. I dont expect to become rich and I know damn well I wont wakeup a millionaire one day. However I have faith and am optimistic about the future of some projects I hold like CRO and ALGO for example. (ETH and BTC too of course). Good things come to those who wait.

Why deflationary money can be both a store of value and a currency,**Tl;dr/conclusion****Looking at it from the level of the individual a deflationary form of money is fundamentally a superior form of money to an inflationary currency. The rational move would be to hold such a deflationary form of currency and to swap into inflationary currencies as needed. Given the possibility it would be attractive for merchants and invididuals to accept payment directly in this deflationary form of money.****While a comparison with gold and the flaws of transacting in gold is often made these flaws no longer need apply. With the advent of crypto we have the possibility to create a form of money that has the advantages of gold without the disadvantages of its physicality.**----------Ive seen this discussion pop up more often recently so lets dive in. In short the argument goes that currencies need to be inflationary so that people are incentivised to spend. A way to see it is to think of inflationary currency as a hot potato — if you dont do anything with it and keep it in cash its going to decline in value. Therefore you might as well spend it or invest it. If you know your food is going to be (ever so slightly) more expensive tomorrow you might as well buy it today.https//preview.redd.it/jqt6kkb272c81.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=160fc72058667fe9322a18b346ad8f741c98cf86In a deflationary form of money (for example a currency with a fixed supply) this incentive is absent. Because of this people will hoard their money rather than spend it or invest it. With no (or less) money being spent merchants drop prices to try and entice people to spend. With dropping prices consumers want to wait longer to purchase stuff because they expect the item they intend to buy will be cheaper again next month compared to now.What this has to do with crypto is that people will often make the claim that crypto can be seen as a store of value rather than a currency. Save your money in a fixed supply asset that you know wont be debased spend your inflationary currency. Because of this crypto wont be used as money. People will hold (HODL) their crypto that is likely to increase their value while spending their fiat money that will decrease in value. Because of this no network effect arises for crypto it remains just a savings (and speculation) vehicle.In the hope of having represented the argument of those that believe money should be inflationary correctly Ill now dive into why I believe this take is in a sense incorrect and stems from issues with the specific forms of non-inflationary currency we have seen so far rather than a fundamental issue with deflationary forms of money.# Why deflationary money is a superior store of valueWhen you have the choice between spending in an asset that is likely to appreciate in value (deflationary) or an asset that is likely to depreciate in value (inflationary) the rational move is to spend in the inflationary asset. Youd prefer to pass on the hot potato. However as in a typical hot potato game the receiver would then again prefer to pass on the hot potato as quickly as possible while preferring to hold a harder form of money.The bigger question here is not whether an individual prefers to pay in an inflationary or a deflationary currency. Rather its about why anyone would **hold** the hot potato when there is the option of passing it on right away. If Im a merchant receiving US dollars and I can convert this into a fixed supply form of money right away that seems like a smarter course of action. If the friction of doing so is low enough Id prefer to hold that harder form of money even if I have to convert back into inflationary currency a few days later.# Run this process through to its conclusion and the question becomes who is holding the hot potato and why?The current answer to this is that the hot potato has some characteristics that make it attractive to use and to hold at least some of it. It tends to be more stable than the fixed supply money. While the hot potato money might fluctuate 2–30% against other currencies on a yearly basis the fixed supply asset currently might fluctuate that much in a day. As an individual or business who cant afford to see 30% of their spending power wiped out in a day such fluctuations are undesirable. Theres also the fact that governments like to be paid in this hot potato money and its commonly accepted in most places which gives hot potato money a great network effect.# What about people not wanting to spend deflationary currency?I believe this argument assumes a flexibility in humans that is at odds with how people live and that is at odds with what history has shown us.Look at how much the average person is making and at how much the average person is spending. Most people are far more preoccupied with paying their rent mortgage buying food and other necessities than they are with the value of their money. As a fun thought experiment — say you need a toothbrush. would you postpone buying a toothbrush if you thought it would be 1% cheaper next month?There are very specific examples we can point to here. Technology (and most things in life) get cheaper over time. Say you were in the market for a television. Specifically its March 29th 2020 and were thinking an [LG OLED55CX6LA](https//tweakers.net/pricewatch/1540272/lg-oled55cx6la-zwart.html) would be great to have. Its top of the market. We check the price and it turns out it retails at €2099. A bit steep.We decide to postpone our purchase for three months. On June 29th 2020 it turns out we can already get the TV for €1668! Three months later on September 29th 2020 its €1299. A full year later we can get this exact same TV for €1098.https//preview.redd.it/hhlfb2f372c81.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=e63ffdb347c51b427ac925bf20e67c7a85a88014Most people are well aware of this and know that it holds for televisions entertainment computers fridges dishwashers and a plethora of other things. Nearly everything gets cheaper if you keep the quality equal. Yet people do not wait infinitely. They buy what they want to have now or when theyve saved up enough money (or even use credit to do so).This is no fluke. A great piece of research on the [Rate of Return on Everything 1870–2015](https//www.frbsf.org/economic-research/files/wp2017-25.pdf) shows that the real rate of return on government bonds & bills has been positive taking into account inflation (p17) for most countries in the world. Since the 1980s it has been on average positive for every country in the world.https//preview.redd.it/4pvcdf4472c81.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=39df26ee074629812708c7cfbefddc91524bc9b9Data for bank savings accounts are harder to find except for specific countries. When we look at specific countries bank savings that are insured by a government deposit guarantee tend to offer an even higher interest rate than government bonds & bills.It is commonly stated that people would postpone purchases and investments under a deflationary money system because peoples money would be worth more tomorrow or a year from now. What the above shows is that there is a safe asset that people can already invest into with small or large amounts knowing their money will be worth more in a year from now yet we havent seen a deflationary collapse yet. It shows that people can already have deflation work in their favor by postponing buying a new TV or computer or a myriad of other things yet we havent seen a deflationary collapse yet.# How could a non-inflationary currency work as currency?Earlier in this article I mentioned how inflationary currency can be seen as a hot potato that is constantly passed on. The question turns into who holds the hot potato. An even more important question is **why** fundamentally anyone would want to be holding the hot potato.Thinking about it from a fundamental point of view I would prefer to hold as little as possible in a form of cash that depreciates. In other words when I receive payment in inflationary currency I would prefer to exchange it into hard money as quickly as possible. When paying others I would convert back into inflationary currency as needed and pay them.However — as this continues and more people think in this way the step of converting back into inflationary currency makes less sense. If I want to hold my money in a fixed supply currency and you have a fixed supply currency but are converting to inflationary currency to pay me with that seems like an inefficient form of exchange.As a merchant I would gladly take your fixed supply currency and could let you know that I accept this fixed supply currency for payment. It saves you the hassle of converting fixed supply into inflationary currency it saves me the hassle of having to swap that inflationary currency back into fixed supply currency.Full efficiency is gained when we have a form of money that is both a fantastic store of value and a fantastic currency. The two strengthen each other — so why have we not seen this so far?# The gold standard and its flawsAt this point youre probably wondering why I havent touched upon the gold standard yet. Its an example of a relatively fixed supply currency. Yet as we broadly observe it is not in use today while gold does serve as a store of value. Why is that?Many economies have had a direct gold-based exchange system at times. Gold (and silver) coins were widely circulated — the Roman aureus was a gold coin later replaced by the Byzantine solidus. Italian denari Spanish dineros and the Florentine florin are well-known examples.These currencies were used within countries and internationally. Gold is a base layer asset the value is in the physical gold itself. Because of this no trust was needed when transacting. A country having a debt settled by another country preferred this to be done in gold because once paid it was fully settled. There was no debt claim no need to trust the counterparty beyond the simple exchange.However carrying around gold is inconvenient at best. Amongst other issues gold is heavy and can be stolen. To solve this issue credible parties (which we today think of as banks) offered to store gold in a secure place giving a paper claim to the deposited gold in exchange. As long as the credible party was credible enough this paper claim was as good as gold while being far easier to transport protect and use.However this also allows banks to lend out this gold to others in exchange for interest. As long as not everyone comes by at the same time to retrieve their gold this would work fine and provides some income for the bank.In the interest of keeping this short Ray Dalios Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order Why Nations Succeed and Fail is a fantastic read. It goes into the next stages of such a system and why we see ebbs and flows in hard money and fiat money.The important part for this analysis is why weve repeatedly seen the move from using gold as a pure medium of exchange to claims on gold and ultimately fiat. Its not because golds (relatively) fixed supply fundamentally makes it unsound to transact with. It is golds other characteristics such as limited portability/transferability and divisibility and its security costs that mean it is not ideal for use as a medium of exchange.Gold is heavy to carry around. Its expensive to transfer large sums because the risk of it being stolen increases so you would need to pay for security. Its hard to divide it down to small amounts — try paying a few cents in gold. Conversely try paying very large amounts in gold to someone far away. The transport costs would be large.# Fixing these flawsSay we were able to create an asset that had a demonstrably and unchangeably fixed supply while fixing the flaws with gold. This asset could be carried anywhere easily and you would be able to transfer 2 cents as easily as you were able to transfer 2 billion. Such a transfer would be confirmed instantly while the transaction would not cost you any fees. As in gold it would be paramount that such a transfer happen trustlessly and that there is no way for people to spend money they do not have.The idea behind cryptocurrency is largely to offer such a form of money. This is one of the reasons a lot of money is flowing into crypto and that many people are so enthusiastic about it. Bitcoin was a first version of this but has some flaws. As an example transferring Bitcoin is not instant and it costs a fair bit. Its not extremely divisible and most importantly does not ensure security.Bitcoins security comes from decentralization from many miners competing for the rewards that come with mining Bitcoin. At the same time mining Bitcoin comes with economies of scale due to the way Bitcoin is designed. In other words Bitcoin is designed to encourage centralization and loss of security over time. For more info see [**Why 99% of cryptocurrencies centralize over time**](https//senatus.substack.com/p/why-99-of-cryptocurrencies-centralize)**.**That does not mean crypto as a whole has failed at this. Nano is a cryptocurrency that offers instant transfers at zero fees from anywhere in the world to anywhere. It is a fixed supply and almost limitlessly divisible (up to 30 decimals). As opposed to Bitcoin Nano does not centralize over time instead decentralizing ever further.In the interest of not making this article even longer I would link to [**crypto as a store of value**](https//senatus.substack.com/p/why-nano-is-the-ultimate-store-of-value-and-reserve-currency-3b0318844bc8)**** and [**the long-term future of crypto**](https//senatus.substack.com/p/on-crypto-as-a-store-of-value-bitcoins) for those interested in the ways that certain cryptocurrencies have solved these issues.# ConclusionLooking at it from the level of the individual a deflationary form of money is fundamentally a superior form of money to an inflationary currency. The rational move would be to hold such a deflationary form of currency and to swap into inflationary currencies as needed. Given the possibility it would be attractive for merchants and invididuals to accept payment directly in this deflationary form of money.While a comparison with gold and the flaws of transacting in gold is often made these flaws no longer need apply. With the advent of crypto we have the possibility to create a form of money that has the advantages of gold without the disadvantages of its physicality.*If this article interests you I would first and foremost recommend the article* [***On crypto as a store of value Bitcoins incentives and the long-term future of crypto***](https//senatus.substack.com/p/on-crypto-as-a-store-of-value-bitcoins)*. I would also recommend this analysis of* [***The theoretical best form of money***](https//senatus.substack.com/p/creating-the-theoretical-best-possible)***.****Mostly I would love to hear comments and feedback. Ive written this down to improve my own thinking and am open to hearing where this is plain wrong or where my thinking could be improved.*--------------- #### Adding in a FAQ since some questions have been asked many times.**Question Wont people stop spending money if their money is deflationary? Wont businesses stop investing?**Answer As it stands today using those assumptions all money is prone not to be spent.  A great piece of research that I linked in this article is the [Rate of Return on Everything](https//www.frbsf.org/economic-research/files/wp2017-25.pdf). It shows that the real rate of return on government bonds and bills has been positive net of inflation for most countries in the world for the past 140 years. Since the 1980s it has been on average positive for every country analzed. The same holds for bank savings accounts though not currently.Given that (a) people have been able to safely/easily save or invest their money and get ~4.5% a year (as an example) with (b) inflation being 2% per year anyone already can make sure they can buy more for their money next year. If I have $1 interest is 0% and deflation is 2% next year I still have $1 and products cost $0.98. If interest is 4% and inflation is 2% next year I have $1.04 and products cost $1.02.What deflation does is increase the purchasing power of $1 over time. Governments bonds and savings accounts have allowed people to do the same for a very long time. In other words when we wonder whether people wont stop spending if their purchasing power increases over time we might want to simply look at the current situation.**Question Wont this make loans impossible? If currency was deflationary a loan would get more expensive over time.**Answer Its not so much about whether there is inflation or deflation when it comes to whether loans get more expensive. To use an example we can have Bob take out a loan using an inflationary or deflationary currency while keeping the net interest rate equal. Say Bob takes out a loan of $100 dollars while his income is $20. If we assume Bob pays interest of 5% inflation is 2% and his salary increases with 2% per year then after 10 years his loan will be $162.89 while his salary would be $24.38. The loan is ~6.7 times as large as his income.Say Bob takes out a loan of $100 dollars while his income is $20. If we assume Bob pays interest of 1% deflation is 2% and his salary decreases with 2% per year then after 10 years his loan will be $110.46 while his salary would be $16.34. The loan is ~6.7 times as large as his income. An alternative way of looking at it is to see what happens to repayment. Bob takes out a loan of $100 dollars while his income is $20. Bob decides hell use 50% of his income to pay off the loan each year.With 5% interest and inflation/wage growth of 2% Bob pays off the loan after ~12 years. With 1% interest and inflation/wage growth of -2% Bob pays off the loan after ~12 years. The major difference in such a system is that there will most likely be a hard lower bound on interest rates. It is unlikely that money would be lent out at 0% or at lower interest rates because it is possible to get a 0% return by just holding your money. This does likely lead to reduced lending - given that there is for example ~$10 trillion in negatively yielding debt that would not be attractive if money can be stored easily at no cost.In other words there would likely be reduced debt but there would not be no debt. Whether that is a good or bad thing is worthy of a discussion all on its own which is why this article mostly focuses on the incentives for an individual rather than the impact on the world economy as a whole.,1749,0.83,2014,2022-01-16 14:23:05
GoFundMe has frozen $4.5 Million in funds collected by protesting Canadian Truckers. Why anti-government protestors use centralised censorable payment systems over decentralised platforms is beyond me,Canadian trucker convoy raised over $4.5m but all of that was frozen by GoFundMe.https//vancouver.citynews.ca/2022/01/25/canada-trucker-convoy-gofundme-frozen/Centralised payment rails can easily be censored by governments. Using them is literally asking to get de-platformed. Not just this time around GoFundMe has a history of freezing users funds for a number of reasons. Its just similar to PayPal where you have to jump through hoops just to access the funds sent for your cause. They may not overtly admit it but a company like GoFundMe must be under a lot of pressure by governments to freeze funds that are meant for anti-government protestors. If crypto is too volatile for them they can use decentralised stablecoins to raise funds. Something like DAI can be most useful in this scenario - it cannot be frozen and can be easily exchanged for fiat. Protests are completely legal in most jurisdictions and these protestors have said they will be using the funds for fuel food and lodgings in taking part in the convoy - all of which is legal. With a crypto credit card they can spend their DAI or any other coin for all their activities. Why they dont prefer using crypto payment rails over GoFundMe is bewildering. Maybe crypto platforms need more awareness.,1746,0.8,1003,2022-01-31 17:52:34

Elizabeth Warrens ex staffer has filed a lawsuit against a Defi protocol after investing $10 in it. And nobody has realised OR could ever realise that the gigantic $10 investment was deliberate in order to file the lawsuit. No dots to connect here.,A chap named Kent had invested $10 in a protocol called PoolTogether which essentially gamifies the process of saving by offering them a chance to win awards from the interest generated by collected funds.A point to note here is- he was a part of Sen. Warrens team during 2020 presidential elections and that in the lawsuit hes described as someone whos gravely concerned at the prospective use of the cryptocurrency. His very legitimate concerns are about climte change and cryptos role in it bad rug pulls subversion of laws set by the society and so on.The lawsuit in itself is not concerning but when you connect the dots on who filed the lawsuit and the purpose behind it- you see that this is but a malicious attempt of ridiculing crypto by only emphasizing a small proportion of use case.

Every single person laughing at NFTs today will be using them in 10 years,NFTs are probably the most hated thing on the internet right now. I can understand why  stupid apes jpegs and the crypto-bro subculture is kinda annoying.But here is what a lot of people need to understand  NFTs are much much more than jpegs. **Its a piece of technology that has the potential to revolutionize a lot of things in our daily digital lives.**Let me illustrate my point. Last week there was an ETH hackaton organized by ETHglobal. In two days participants created 255 different projects related to NFTs. Heres some very interesting projects that have nothing to do with stupid jpegs * Creativerse a Minecraft server connected to Ethereum where lands and buildings are turned into NFTs - that means that nobody can censor you. * 0xPhotos a stock photography marketplace that enable creators to get royalties everytime their photo is used. * veNFT a DeFi projects that gives rewards to owners willing to stake their NFT. * ENS-Signature which aim to integrate Ethereum Universal Sign-In into official documents such as DocuSigns. I think Ive made my point  we are in the very early stages of a groundbreaking technology going mainstream. In ten years those of us who choose to invest in this sector will be called lucky by the very same people that are laughing at NFTs right now.Keep your mind open. Dont believe the lies ignorant people are telling you. DYOR and you will see a lot of opportunities. **NFTs will be everywhere in our digital lives in less than a decade.**(Id like to give credit to Twitter user CroissantETH for opening my eyes about this subject. The projects listed above are from one of his thread.)(I swear to god the first person to reply bUt I cAn RiGhT-cLiCk AnD sAvE tHe JpEgS!!1!! is getting replied to with a very mean GIF.

On the contrary it would be very very healthy to eat broccoli more often.Instead you keep reaching for one of the thousands of sweets that seem so delicious. They have such interesting names and the packaging says all sorts of great things. When youre out shopping you just cant avoid putting them in your cart.The sweets can satisfy your cravings much better than the boring broccoli. You know that could hurt you.

Right now Im seeing some sentiment about holding LRC and panicking because it keeps dipping and is not going up.**Breaking news cryptocurrency are highly volatile and it not only goes up but it may go down too.**You cant say oh I wish I bought BTC back in 2011… Id be so rich now 🤑🤑🤑 and at the same time panic because LRC dipped. You most likely bought it because of the hype or best case scenario because you believe in the project. In that case you wouldnt have to worry about anything anyway.Dont be upset about price action and it might help not looking at charts for a while. If you *really* believe in the project and didnt invest what you cant afford to lose just buy the dip and hodl.,1550,0.85,764,2022-01-17 07:46:00
If you want to make money day trading try this first,Day trade on paper for at least a month or even longer. (Without actually making the trades)I got this advice a few years ago but didnt listen and was down 50%.It sounds odd but itll show you how hard and unpredictable it is especially with crypto.Literally write every trade you would have made with your crypto and see if youre really in the green after at least a month.This will be a great way to learn you cant always time the market without losing a big chunk of your money.Im not saying day trading isnt possible but make your mistakes on paper first.,1493,0.94,844,2022-02-08 14:21:21

What the hell happened this time?,I was drinking coffee with a friend today and one of the conversations was about cryptocurrencies and how prices have been dropping lately. I checked on my portfolio during the conversation and I saw that everything was green COSMOS was even up double digits. Great I said. Maybe this is the start of an uptrend.I get home take a shower and go to bed. Woke up and decided to see if the uptrend continues but all I see is a wall of red. Its worse than it was yesterday. Does anyone have any idea what happened? What triggered this double digit dip? I know crypto is volatile but there has to be some kind of explanation or reasoning behind this.,1433,0.92,1710,2022-01-21 00:30:18
What was said in the Crypto Hearing in Congress just now Cleaning Up Cryptocurrency The Energy Impacts of Blockchains Questions., The hearing [https//www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWg731-3id8](https//www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWg731-3id8) **TLDR Bullish and interesting****Question 1 from  Diana Degette to  Ari Juels** **Is there a way to do Proof of work without wasting energy or electronic waste?** He answers that there is no other way but there is always Proof of Stake (he shills it at every occasion)**Question 2 (same speakers)** **Do people have incentives to go to the cheapest energy to mine?**Yes but there is always proof of stake (Diana Degette shuts him saying theyll come to that later) **Question 3  Diana Degette to  John Belizaire** **Why the energy consumption is a feature not a bug?** => The energy consumption is here to protect the network and lock in the value. **Question 4 Diana Degette to  Steve Wright** **Sometimes Renewable are not the cheapest right?** Yes**Question 5 Diana Degette to  Brian P. Brooks** **You mention that proof of work cant shift to proof of stake why?** The proof of work makes a big value compared to other industries per consumption of energy. **Proof of Stake poses problems of security because of the holders but proof of work is more resilient and more decentralized** ____________________________________________________________________________New Character arrives David McKinley [https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_McKinley](https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_McKinley)Cries about the hearing being a distraction from real problems. Says that states without renewable are discriminated because of renewable. He is mainly ranting. **He asks could miners rely on renewable to Greg Zerzan** Answer Yes as long as it is cheap and as long as the US is a net exporter of energy. ____________________________________________________________________**Back to  Frank Pallone  who asks The concern about high power consumption and the future of it to Greg Zerzan** Greg Zerzan speaks about data centers using also a lot of data. **Frank Pallone asks why the 0.5% of energy consumption is credible to Ari Juels** Derived from Hashrate. Frank Pallone asks Steve wright how can we make sure consumers dont pay more because of miners. The dude lags hardcore and I cant get a grip of what the fuck he said. Seriously this is a US congress hearing and I have a better connection that this dude. (the congressman didnt understand too and asked for a written answer LMAO) **Cathy McMorris asks of Zerzan how blockchain can empower the consumer?** He explains how it makes people control their data which undercuts Facebook google and all other Big tech companies. **McMorris explains how the job boom of blockchain is outpacing other industries and asks about the value from these jobs?** Zerzan explains how cryptos are the blood of the blockchain and that these experts are needed to make the cryptos and blockchain work. **Mc Morris asks Steve wright (the laggy boy) what are the negative impacts of crypto mining**He says his community is scared by unregulated currencies and that they are skeptical about these technologies but doesnt answer the question. _________________________________________________________________________________________________New character Anne Kuster [https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Kuster](https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Kuster) She explains how many assets exist and how the industry is growing and helping the world. She questions the sustainability. She explains that some leaders in the POW are trying their best to be green and to make big projects to develop a better power grid. **She asks Brian P. Brooks What are the innovation in the future of the crypto mining?** Brooks explains how crypto is not about tax evasion or money laundering he explains how bitcoin is the most decentralized crypto and that there is value in decentralization. He explains how companies in this space are starting to fight against the giant in tech. **He says decentralization is safer fairer and the future.** **She asks John Bellzaire what are the exiled miners from China searching in the US ?**He explains that miners who have suffered from the great unplugging have been searching for a free market with a real ecosystem (insurance companies etc) rule of law and are trying to thrive in the larger US economy. _________________________________________________________________________________NEW DLC CHARACTER Neal Dunn [https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Dunn](https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Dunn)Is very pro crypto says he accepts crypto campaign donations. He wants to let the market decide. He says that they should help crypto to thrive instead of regulating it. He asks Brooks **how halving will help miners who are more efficients and to be more energy efficient?**Brooks explains that these halving are seen as the next big rise in the crypto sector and are pushing progress in a lot of other sectors such as cooling industries. **He asks Brooks how chips technology is benefiting from Bitcoin POW.** Brooks explains how they have pushed specialized chip tech forward and that they made leaps comparable to the tech leaps produced by the Space program. **He asks brooks if miners in other countries are dirtier isnt the solution to welcome them in the US?** Brooks answers yes. __________________________________________________________________________________NEW DLC CHARACTER Jan Schakowsky [https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Schakowsky](https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Schakowsky)**Focuses on the old plants re-opened and how economics can push the miners to fossil fuels. (She seems very old)** **Asks about that to Steve Wright** He answers that as coal is less and less demanded due to regulation the prices get lowers and some may be interested in these products. Asks John Bellzaire about cleaner sources and says she is skeptical about crypto and about the fact that they use fossil fuel. (she is anti crypto I think but yay) John Bellzaire answers that Crypto brings huge capital which help with the transformative of the grid and of the zero carbon footprint. The capital deployed in clean energy is currently virtualy infinite because of subsidies and of crypto capital. She says that they should hope Bellzaires vision comes to fruition __________________________________ **Morgan Griffith asks if Southwest Virginia could profit from the fact that it has cold temperatures to Brooks.** Brooks says yes. **He then asks the same to other people who say all yes**. **He voices concern that congress should not regulate the crypto space out of existence and asks Brooks what he thinks about this.** Brooks answers that Bitcoins value is not about the market cap of Bitcoin but about the transactions and about the fact that Bitcoin is the bedrock of the crypto ecosystem. So Bitcoin should be protected. **He asks Zerzan if China ban on crypto shows an anti freedom stance.** Zerzan says that crypto is freedom and some people dont like freedom. _______________________________________________________________New character Paul Tonko [https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Tonko](https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Tonko)Says that a lot of miners are interested in the energy in New York. **Asks Bellzaire if it is possible to ban crypto miners from fossil fuel?** Bellzaire explains that this could be feasible through carbon tax credits or financial incentives to develop flexible load environement. And that they could also incentive Green energy producer to team up with miners. **He then Asks Juels if consuming excess energy from renewable has opportunity cost**Juels answers by saying that he needs to repair something that was said Mining rigs are more efficient over time but it doesnt mean that the energy infused has been reduced. And doesnt answer. **The law maker ask again why he believes that this excess energy is wasted when used on POW?**Juels answers that **it is because proof of stake exist and that the concerns about the centralization of POS are very theoretical. For him it is not proven yet that the validators could break it. He says that this energy could go else where gives a very bad answer.** **______________________________________________________________________________**New character Scott Peters [https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Peters_(politician)](https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Peters_(politician)) **Asks to Brooks is it possible to reduce consumption with better equipment?** Brooks says that yes in fact the energy efficiency of energy/ hash has improved dramatically and that the industries benefiting from Asic have gained a lot thanks to the funding in R&D funding from miners. **Asks to Juels why he says that it is in fact not reducing consumption or being more efficient.** Juels explains that he doesnt measure energy consumption / hash but per transaction and in that sense Bitcoin is very energy intensive. He also says that the lightening network is not used a lot and in its infancy and remains to be seen how succesful it is. (lol talks about millions of people using it daily...) **Asks to Bellzaire how his vision of flexibility translate in application.**Bellzaire answers that these datacenters decentralized could help with algorithms and other problems not only POW but bringing valuable applications. __________________________________________________________________________New Character Kim Schrier [https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Schrier](https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Schrier)**Asks Steve Wright how they managed cost of energy to help consumers while allowing mining.** He answers that they have bought reserves and made contracts with miners (I cant understand him well) **The law maker kim schrier is saying Do you think that despite the ransomware the drug and human traffics are crypto really bringing value to humanity? (what a moron)** Steve Wrights says it depends and it depends on regulations **he wants a mechanism to be sure crypto is not used in the wrong way (decentralization is not about this).** **She then asks him about a dam contract with canada which is totally unrelated.** ___________________________________________________________________________________________New Character Lori Trahan [https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lori_Trahan](https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lori_Trahan) **Directly asks Brooks if the number of miners is important.** Brooks answers that it is not that important **at least less than in proof of stake** since POW cant be tricked and the lottery makes collusion impossible but **proof of stake allows for collusion and modification of blockchain.** **She Asks Juels about proof of stake consolidation and is it a real alternative to POW.** Juels says that the concern is not about POS or POW but about centralization and that POW is not better in that front. Juels says that the real concern is about the rich being richer but that most problems are unrelated to POS or POW. (He is cheerleading for POS) **Asks juels what is the danger of centralization** Juels explains that the problem would be an overtake of the blockchain and a control of the transactions. ________________________________________________________________________New char Tom OHalleran [https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_O%27Halleran](https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_O%27Halleran) **Asks Wright the difference between datacenters and crypto mining as consumers of energy.** Wright answers that data centers were better prepared to approach the energy industry and that Bitcoin miners were unprepared**The lawmaker asks what growth in jobs is made in these industries**Bellzaire answers that the jobs produced per energy is not known by him BUT that they are creating high value jobs such as data technicians and that the value is high. ____________________________________________________________________________________New Character Darren Soto  [https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darren_Soto](https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darren_Soto)&#x200B;Says that Crypto is very mystifying and that Crypto can be a future a currency a commodity and a security. This committee is the first to have passed bills to establish these kind of definitions and also taxation rules. He wants to make sure that Crypto is not used by terrorist and wants way to claw back some of the money. Says he is concerned with the energy use and how coal plants are re-opened because of Bitcoin. He says that if crypto is the currency of the future we cant destroy the planet to make it work. **Asks Juels how Data oracles can make blockchain more efficient?** Juels says that oracles are not making these more efficient it is not their role. He says that Smart Contracts are actually at the core of this. He says that blockchain are not connected to internet and that the oracle is the link between blockchain and offchain systems. the eyes and ears of smart contracts **Asks Brooks what the gov should do to encourage less energy intensive efforts?** Brooks answers that the market is the best answer it depends on a lot of costs and Bitcoin is an energy derivative which can be used to understand the best role of energy at a current time. **Brooks also says that his companies are talking to wind farms and solar farms not coal plants. The anecdotal stories of coal plants are not the reality. The vast majority of Bitcoin miners are providing a base load consumption to Green energy producers.** ____________________________________________________________________________________The thing concludes with Degette saying that they are happy with answers today and want to know how in the future if miners are located in the US how will the energy spending evolve. She says that the testimonies were of the utmost value today.,1402,0.97,341,2022-01-20 18:43:30

Its so unbeliveably refreshing to see Elons tweets have almost 0 affect on the price of something. The influencer effect is dying.,DOGE was a whopping .14 cents when I woke up at 6 a.m. at 730 A.M the price jumped 12% and within 5 minutes was back down to .14 cents and now sits at a 3% total gain for the day... Its so nice that the clear pumping from influencers is dying down. Regardless of how you feel about DOGE any crypto banking on a billionaire just trying to fill their own bags is terrible and will most likely leave you burned.If youre curious someone actually wrote a code and tabled all of Elons tweets in correlation with the price. https//www.r-bloggers.com/2021/07/the-elon-musk-tweet-effect-on-dogecoin-doge/ his affect is definitely dying out.,1388,0.9,298,2022-01-25 23:02:17
This is how insanely secure the Bitcoin network really is,Bitcoin is the most secure network in existence. The way the network is built is pure genius and the bigger it gets the more secure it becomes.In 2011 Dan Kaminsky a leading Internet-security researcher investigated the currency and was sure he would find major weaknesses. Kaminsky is famous among hackers for discovering in 2008 a fundamental flaw in the Internet which would have allowed a skilled coder to take over any Web site or even to shut down the Internet. Kaminsky alerted the Department of Homeland Security and executives at Microsoft and Cisco to the problem and worked with them to patch it. He is one of the most adept practitioners of penetration testing the art of compromising the security of computer systems at the behest of owners who want to know their vulnerabilities.Guess what he said when he tried to break Bitcoin?*When I first looked at the code I was sure I was going to be able to break it. The way the whole thing was formatted was insane. Only the most paranoid painstaking coder in the world could avoid making mistakes.*He thought he had identified nine ways to compromise the system and scoured Nakamotos code for an insertion point for his first attack. But when he found the right spot there was a message waiting for him. Attack Removed it said. The same thing happened over and over infuriating Kaminsky. *I came up with beautiful bugs. But every time I went after the code there was a line that addressed the problem.*He was like a burglar who was certain that he could break into a bank by digging a tunnel drilling through a wall or climbing down a vent and on each attempt he discovered a freshly poured cement barrier with a sign telling him to go home. *Ive never seen anything like it* Kaminsky said still in awe.*Either theres a team of people who worked on this or this guy is a genius.***TLDR Buy Bitcoin**[Source](https//www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/10/10/the-crypto-currency/),1385,0.91,804,2022-02-05 21:43:37

I am digging through old posts and articles with bitcoin price predictions and I found this one very interessting.,Note The Article (link below) was published in September 2019 5 months before the Covid Crash. The Price was around 10 000 USD. The Author called* the price will reach $100 000 per bitcoin no earlier than 2021 and no  later than 2028. After 2028 the price will never drop below $100 000 * the price will reach $1 000 000 per bitcoin no earlier than 2028 and no  later than 2037. After 2037 the price will never drop below $100 000 [I added todays Price in Black and the Covid Crash in Red.

16844 crypto currencies. 80% of them are pure garbage,According to Coin Market cap there are 16844 cryptos out on the world market although Coin Gecko shows 12463. Still thats a shitload. No wonder some of my non crypto friends think crypto is simply a penny stock market. Those of us in the space know some project have very good intentions and fail.  Some succeed. Some just hang out. But so many others are pure scam and we all know it. I guess that is the price of decentralization and I sometimes struggle with this. We dont believe in censorship so why would we be in the business of telling new projects they arent allowed because we are already too many in the room.Sadly too many people will invest their life in dumb things like squid game tokens only to find no liquidity when trying to cash out. Others will simply be rug pulled. The worse part is the hit we as investors and believers of fundamentals take as it creates a bad reputation and gives crypto a terrible image. If politicians and regulators should have a beef with anything about crypto its these shady scam projects but how to determine a shady scam project until it is officially a scam. Many people in the crypto world still say Shib for example is a scam and thats their opinion. Many people not in crypto say Bitcoin is a scam. Many bitcoiners say ethereum is a scam and so on.  So where do we go from here? One critique politicians often use is crypto cant police itself when it comes to these scams and rug pulls so they need harsh and strict regulation to be enforced and penalized.  How can crypto police itself when project tribes cant stand each other and all they do is throw each other trash on twitter. My hope is that in time as more and more people come in there are better educational tools for noobs to be aware of what is a fire hazard but I am not optimistic. People will do what they want to do in hopes of hitting a moon shot and some shady scammers know this so I imagine that number I typed in the title will likely reach 20000 or 250000 by the time 2022 is over.,1359,0.95,2534,2022-01-16 03:17:16
Its incredible how quickly a few green candles changes the general sentiment in this subreddit.,I dont want to come off as a killjoy; Im as hyped as anyone here. But it was only a few days ago when everyone thought we were in the middle of a bear market a few green candles later and its posts calling for altseason and short squeezes. Its insane what one day of green does to people. Pumps are exciting but we need to calm down a bit.Dont forget we are still in a downtrend and history shows that pumps can disappear as fast as they appeared. So dont make any reckless decisions stick to the plans you made before this pump and calm down a bit. Youll do better if you stay humble and keep a level head on yourself.

I hate the fact that Facebook (a company known for privacy manipulation) is entering the crypto market (a market which thrives off of privacy).,Or at least used to thrive off of privacy now that there are things like KYC on almost every centralized exchange.But still no centralized exchange will ever be as bad as Facebooks Meta.I despise them. They steal our private info to sell to companies for ad targeting.Watch how the market will start getting littered with ads (even ones unrelated to crypto) once Meta starts monopolizing the crypto space.I think the only way to avoid this would be through allowing publishers to monetize without ads through users processing power. Networks like Gather are already doing that so lets hope this swerves away companies like Facebook and Google.,1321,0.91,944,2022-01-14 01:01:51
A Crypto short squeeze might be happening right now and it can completely reverse the current trajectory of the market.,Bitcoin seems to have shot past its $40k barrier in a matter of hours and it is likely to continue considering how many people are shorting the market right now. Crypto hasnt yet lost its steam and it was dragged down by the stock market for the past few days. This has accumulated A LOT of shorters.[Short positions are extremely high](https//preview.redd.it/lx6hz6ct4vf81.jpg?width=1525&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3a4eec27f4f445c3f55ba4977521da9c6237463b)Just looking at this alone should give you a picture of what has been happening. There are a lot of people that are shorting the market right now and a Bitcoin short squeeze is likely considering that whales have been eating up the weeks long selling pressure with huge purchases. # Short  Squeeze Indications*  **Substantial amount of buying pressure.**  ✅ * **RSI below 30 for an unnatural amount of time.** ✅ * **Short interest way above 20%.**  ✅ * **Huge sudden uptick in price.** ✅ The market indications are suggesting a textbook short squeeze scenario for Bitcoin and that might potentially reverse the Crypto markets trajectory. Remember Bitcoin is already 10% up in a matter of a few hours. This means people shorting are at a loss and they will either have to sell at a loss or borrow more shares driving up the price. **TLDR** Bitcoin closed one of the biggest green candles in over a year and it is most likely the beginning of a short squeeze due to an unusually large amount of people shorting the market. Moreover surpassing 40k in a matter of  hours just invalidated weeks of FUD. If this continues investors will be looking at a bullish Crypto market and a bearish stock market which is possibly the best environment for another huge bull run.,1315,0.74,887,2022-02-04 19:29:31

People dont want to hear this but were investing in crypto so we can have more money in traditional currencies,As much as you love the technology behind cryptocurrencies and various projects 99% of people are here for money.And as much as they are supporters of cryptocurrencies 99% of people do it to have more money in fiat currencies so they can achieve their goals.When trading with cryptocurrencies we compare their value with the euro dollar pound etc.  Currently we are comparing the value of everything to our current fiat price.An international financial system such as crypto takes time to adapt and I can only imagine what awaits us in the future but I belive that even then we will still compare value with traditional currencies.The main goal of crypto is decentralization. We all want it yet when we take profit we take it from centralized place. Stablecoins are backed by traditional currencies which are again centralized.,1310,0.88,831,2022-01-11 18:43:11
Anybody feel like celebrities are not paying for the Ape NFTs??,I have seen all over the news of different celebrities paying exorbitant amounts for the Ape NFTs and it just feels super inorganic and forced. There are many celebrities that have supposedly bought these NFTs and now have changed their profile picture to the Ape they own. Some of the prominent ones include Future Lil Baby and Jimmy Fallon all spending 500K+. And while I dont doubt they couldnt afford it as they are all obviously multimillionaires. I do not believe they are actually buying them. My working theory is that they are simply getting them for or even getting paid to market these NFTs and its just the NFT owners wash trading between their own ETH wallets to create Artificial demand and contribute to the price inflation. The most recent one I saw was Justin Bieber buying an Ape NFT for around 500 ETH (over 1 million USD). When the base price of the NFT was 250K. I refuse to believe celebrities at their own willingness are overpaying for these. Once again I understand that a celebrity like Justin Bieber could in theory afford to throw a million at something like this. But just doesnt seem like something he would rationally do without ulterior motives. Welcoming any thoughts people have on this? Just want to disclaim I am not against NFTs and believe the tech and potential of it is amazing but the current use case is absurd and indicative of a artificially inflated bubble(this is coming from someone that made a few ETH flipping NFTs),1290,0.94,724,2022-01-30 15:25:19

If you are panic selling instead of accumulating right now or at least hodling you are doing it wrong,In tough times like these its important to take a BIG step back and remember the plan. Its pretty simple buy low sell high.Ive been around the block a few times and let me tell you that the LAST thing you want to be is the last seller in a crash. Those people are the ones who give their money to the people who are investing correctly. I promise you there will be a better opportunity than today for you to sell in the future.If you sold last week congrats buy back in now to lock in a nice gain in coins. The bottom is too hard to time and itll probably happen in the middle of the night and get away from you before you have a chance. Then youll be waiting for it to come back down then itll go above your sell price and youll lose coins.

Hats off to Kraken who now let users verify that the balances they hold are backed by real assets,While Im not the biggest fan of centralized exchanges I think its still the best way for noobs to learn about crypto. In this sense the trust relationship between holders and CEXs is crucial when you buy BTC or ETH you want the exchange to actually own these tokens.Thats why I was very pleased to learn today that Kraken has [just launched a new way](https//www.kraken.com/proof-of-reserves/?utm_source=content+announcement&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=por+announcement&utm_content=content+link&j=239745&sfmc_sub=49972818&l=227_HTML&u=3691634&mid=514004678&jb=121) for their customers to verify with cryptographic proof that their tokens are actually in their accounts.Its called proof of reserves and heres how it works. Twice a year an auditor takes an anonymized snapshot of all balances held and aggregates them into what is called a Merkle tree a private database that encapsulates all client balances. Some cryptographic magic happens (the actual operation is quite complicated to go over in this post) and voilà! Users can now verify their balances with a few clicks.**You dont have to take Kraken words for granted  they can prove to you theyre actually holding the tokens you bought.**In full disclosure I have to say that Ive been a Kraken customer since I started in crypto so Im not entirely neutral. However in my opinion this kind of practice allows our ecosystem to gain credibility. The days of Mt. Gox and Quadriga are well and truly over!,1279,0.97,267,2022-02-04 16:44:55

Why we need decentralisation my YouTube account got permanently demonetised for no apparent reason,Im a crypto YouTuber and content writer but before you start throwing rocks at me and call me a shill I teach people how to build and test cryptocurrency trading algorithms as a means of automating their trading strategies or simply to experiment with algo trading in a safe testing environment.Some of you may have seen my previous posts where I open source entire projects and share them with the community if I feel like they could add value to you guys. I like doing it and it makes feel good that you guys appreciate the content so much.Because everything that I build is open source and available for everyone the only way that Ive been able to monetise my passion is by becoming a YouTube partner and monetising my videos.I dont make a huge amount but enough to keep me hopeful that one day it will grow and actually make a difference.Heres a video I just made explaining the whole thing in more detail. Im also using that video to raise awareness against the corrupted mess that is YouTube so if you feel like helping feel free to share this video with other people who might not understand just how destructive these corporations are for the freedom of our Internet [**https//youtu.be/VRJXvJnUWV8**](https//youtu.be/VRJXvJnUWV8)Ive recently received an e-mail from Google telling me that my Adsense account has been cancelled. For those that dont know without an adsense account you cant get paid by YouTube.

Can someone explain to me how people fall for scams like Send crypto to this adress to double it?,Seriously I have seen an alarming amout of posts where people have come to this sub crying about their mistake/greed after falling for these scams. I am much younger than the average user of this subreddit and I know for a fact that I would never fall for such scams.So these scams go something like this-Its usually a youtube live video of a conference where Elon Musk Jack Dorsey or Vitalik Buterin with 12k to 20k live viewers which are bots with a flashing sign with a wallet QR code saying if you send crypto to this address well send double back. These conferences are so old that a simple Google image search if these conference would be enough to know for a fact that it is a scam. Is it just that people are too greedy? I am only 16 and sometimes wonder that if adults are just money hungry dumb dumbs. Please people do not disappoint me.Edit- Thanks for the awards guys your notis have been lost in the sea of other notifications and I am not able to personally thank you.,1272,0.94,1627,2022-01-11 10:49:05
If youre in for the long term then these prices should be making you fucking ecstatic.,If you are in the tech for the future and are building for several years a drop of 20% should be celebrated.

As statistically most of you out there have portfolios in the red right now heres a list of less embarrassing reasons to tell people instead of saying you lost it on crypto,1. I have a drinking problem (made more convincing if you actually have one which if the market keeps dropping you probably will soon).2. I have a drug problem but Im getting help.3. I have a drug problem and Im never getting help.4. I have a gambling problem (the best lies are the ones that are also true so this one is a good one!)5. Im having an affair with my much younger and hotter receptionist.6. I used to have an affair with my receptionist and she now has my bastard child that I need to support.7. I have very specific pornography tastes that require expensive donations to have carried out (you will NEVER receive follow up questions on this one!)8. I purchased and then lost 11 wallets full of cash one after another.9. I brought a new home to live in but I forgot the address of where it is.10. I traded it all for magic beans in the hope of a beanstalk growing in my garden and allowing me to find the golden goose (this one is more of a retelling than a lie).,1240,0.91,600,2022-01-18 11:31:02
Crypto needs to introspect. The entire space has been usurped by greed ponzi farms gamblers NFT grifters scammers.. In the eye of a normal person all of these bring zero legitimacy to the space. A long bear market is good for weeding out all this nonsense,We just saw a cycle where useless dog coins ran up to 50 BN market cap and more. People were selling millions of dollar worth profile pictures. Scams and hacks were a daily occurrence. The NFT space was and continues to be a perpetual clown show lions penguins dogs punk jpegs being sold for thousands of dollars. What even is this market. It puts every other bubble in history of mankind to shame. If you wonder why the non-crypto crowd hates crypto and NFT viciously its not an isolated incident or two but a culmination of multiple events that are textbook examples of the worst capitalism has to offer. Earlier in 2021 when I saw hit pieces against crypto I thought they were quite wrong and were attacking crypto as they missed out on the gains. But over time its very clear that there is a lot of merit to the attacks on crypto. The entire space has become a circus of greed scams zero sum offerings where one is looking to profit from another. If you go to other reddit subs like r/technology they are all spot on about crypto the whole space is one big clown world detached from fundamentals. You dont even need to bring in energy consumption into this even without it crypto is a market aggregating the worsts of the worst. Even now there is little to no real world adoption of crypto and instead you have a perpetual grifting scheme where people rush into new launches just to dump them at a higher value and profit off late entrants. Think 2017 cycle but on steroids with thousands of new coins. You have exchanges and other large players legitimising ponzi schemes by giving them attention and even running dog money competitions. You had large defi protocols add ponzi tokens as collateral. Guess what happens to that $100k loan that was taken out using OHM as collateral when OHM itself crashes 80% in a matter of weeks. A culmination of all of these is cascading liquidations and steep corrections. You have coins with 50 BN FDV where insiders hold 90% of the supply and retail buys these coins at the very top because they told to FOMOing into every coin that an exchange adds. In particular what FTX and the whole scam Sam ecosystem they have encouraged is disgusting if not downright criminal. Institutions and VCs got into these coins at cents to the dollar valuation and exchanges added them at exorbitant valuations allowing the insiders to cash out handsomely within just weeks. Influencers and ponzi pumpers ran with FDV is a meme narrative so that they can encourage retail to pile into these scams.If you were even a small sized fund in this space your limited partners were all chasing for maximal returns and exchanges facilitated all of this greed all of them except retail knew that the loose monetary policy wasnt going to last and it was time to make the most out of it. Ultimately its the retail user and the crypto as a whole itself that suffers. For a regular user of r/technology he probably woudnt care that its Alameda Research or A16Z thats behind a lot of these worthless hype tokens but his indictment would fall on crypto as a whole. The partner of a crypto VC fund gives zero fucks if cryptos reputation goes down the drain he has made his millions and is happy collecting his share of profits.If you really believe in the tech and vision of crypto you have every reason to be angry about what the space has turned into since the pandemic crash. It has been one relentless machine churning out scam after scam. A bear market offers actual builders to work in peace building good products that the users needs while removing all the baggage that comes with increasing prices and the vicious cycle of people looking to profit from one another and heightened regulatory attention that grifters and scams bring to crypto as a whole. Crypto has a lot to offer the world but only if the right products are built offering value to users. A ponzi farm and fork of a liquidity mining pool aint it champ.,1229,0.91,550,2022-01-23 10:21:31

12 reasons Cardano cant scale in 2022,This post is a reality check on IOHKs latest investor disinformation campaign https//iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2022/01/14/how-we-re-scaling-cardano-in-2022/Tldr Its great to see they are starting to acknowledge Cardanos scalability problem or at least pumping the brakes on their unsubstantiated claims of having solved the trilemma. For the first time 2021 saw the Cardano community publicly acknowledge some of the limitations of their design that critics have pointed out for years. Weve come a long way since IOHK was still pretending this was almost ready to gohttps//nitter.net/iohk_charles/status/1287481374224420864**1. BLOCK SIZE/ 2. MEMORY/ 3. STORAGE INCREASES**The bigger the blocks the higher the memory and the more storage- the faster the chain. Basically every chain that isnt already run on super computers can increase blocksizes memory or storage requirements if they are OK with more centralization and less stability. Thats the trade off. Thats true for Cardano and its true for every other chain. But how much room does Cardano have to increase parameters? Cardano already has pretty much the same blocksize as Ethereum (72Kb vs ETHs average of 80Kb) and dramatic increases in blocksize will decrease the number of people who can afford to run nodes and it also makes the network more likely to fork. The theoretical max limit is 28x the current blocksize but that is almost certainly not practically possible and no one supports increasing it to even half of that (which is about the most that has ever been tested) because increasing the blocksize isnt free. How critical is it for Cardano to maintain as small of blocksizes as possible? Critical enough that the plan is to only increase in 12.5% intervals when absolutely necessary. The fact that anyone is at all hesitant to increase Cardanos limit when its 72kb tells you that this isnt a free trade. There is no plan to ever reach max parameters. https//np.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/pf25jk/without_hydra_cardano_probably_wont_be_faster/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=shareWhat makes Cardano fundamentally slower than every other chain is how bloated their tx sizes are. Weve all heard the sales pitch And Cardano has native tokens that dont need smart contracts! but what you didnt get told is that native UTXO txs on Cardano are an average of 500 bytes WITHOUT smart contracts. And that a basic native tx is larger than the average Ethereum tx WITH smart contracts. And no the And Cardano can combine 20 txs into 1 ! meme doesnt make any difference. The size and speed of each block is all the same regardless of whether you call it 1 tx or 20txs. The only thing combining txs does is make Cardano significantly cheaper to DDOS. https//messari.io/asset/ethereum/metrics/network-activityNative Cardano UTXOs are bigger than the average Ethereum tx and Plutus smart contracts txs are even bigger that - a lot bigger- like 40x the size of Ethereum smart contracts**Sundaeswap determined that the Cardano network was their primary bottle neck and measured Cardanos real-world throughput for their smart contracts to be 0.15 TPS.** Thats 47x slower than a native UTXO on Cardano 100x slower than an Ethereum tx and 66000x slower than a Cosmos and Terra tx. 0.15 TPS is a max of 12960 txs per day under ideal conditions... on the entire Cardano chain. https//sundaeswap-finance.medium.com/expectations-congestion-mainnet-launch-e9da5abfd819Edit Sunday swaps medium posts are all offline now. https//web.archive.org/web/20220117005224/https//sundaeswap-finance.medium.com/expectations-congestion-mainnet-launch-e9da5abfd819Cardanos problem is much bigger than anything that can be fixed with a 2x parameter adjustment. Max parameters will never be implemented and even then they would still leave Cardano more than 3x slower than the second slowest L1 chain Ethereum.  **4. Pipe Lining and 5. Input Endorsers**...are great ideas. So why are these still in the research phase? Theyre promising to deliver a plan that hasnt even been designed yet. Lets assume these get designed and developed in 2022. Then Cardano is in the ballpark of Ethereum L1s low tps and high congestion. **6. Plutus Script Enhancements**These are basic functions (that are still in the research phase because of how they conflict with provability in Hydra). Plutus should not even have been released before they developed reference and data inputs. That was an obvious problem and it was a huge mistake that will create chaos and disappointment. Edit putting something as basic and critical as reference inputs on the roadmap for 9 months after smart contracts are released is the definition of move fast and break things. Also nobody has explained how they solved the conflict with provability. They didnt leave it out of Plutus because its a minor problem https//m.youtube.com/watch?v=3dc6zG9EjWE&t=37m30sCardano will alway have much larger txs than non-UTXO chains because native UTXOs are so large. On top of that Plutus smart contract implementation is extremely bloated and inefficient. The problem is that Cardanos UTXO model cant store smart contracts on-chain. So instead of calling an on-chain smart contract every Cardano SC tx must include the SC script in every tx because there is no on-chain SC that can simply be referenced again and again. This makes every Cardano smart contract very large. Cardano currently does native asset txs (without smart contracts) at 7 TPS and thats the theoretical minimum SC size if they figure out how to compress SCs 47x. And that means that Cardano SCs will always be at least twice as slow as Ethereum L1s unbearably slow 15 TPS for the same blocksize. Now is a good time to point out that its clear from their rhetorical focus of comparing their chain to the next slowest chain that Cardano holders have no idea how slow Ethereum is. Up to this point in time almost all of Cardanos txs have been basic UTXOs that havent filled up blocks because they are a small fraction of the size of smart contracts. Four months after going live no one really uses smart contracts on Cardano yet. Muesliswap doesnt even have $100 Million in TVL (and doesnt have $5M in liquidity to other tokens). Small NFT drops did bring the network to a crawl but we havent seen speeds across the whole network change dramatically like they will when Sundaeswap launches a real DEX and much bigger txs flood the chain Thursday. And catching up to Ethereum L1 will not be good enough. Ethereum has L2s already and nobody would use Eth L1 if it went live for the first time today. Ethereum has the first mover advantage of having all the liquidity. Whales dont care about a $200 fee they care about liquidity. They need to move in and out of large positions quickly with as little price impact and slippage as possible.  **7. Node Enhancements**This is not a scaling solution. Yes fix your bugs and optimize your code. No other chain thinks a node update is a scaling solution. This is ridiculous. Let me say this again Cardano is currently 66000x slower than Cosmos and Terra.**8. Side-chains**Great idea. But Cardano doesnt have any decentralized side-chains and they didnt even get serious about funding any until late last summer. Proper sidechains are the real solution. Milkomeda is on the right track with their M1 sidechain. Its an accounts model Solidity EVM sidechain that has 32 permissioned nodes and uses slashing. Congratulations on abandoning all of your stated goals and rushing to produce something usable. We waited six years so Catalyst could fund BSC 2.0.https//dcspark.gitbook.io/milkomeda/our-solution-1/the-m-1-sidechain**9. Hydra**A comprehensive plan for interhead Hydra implementation that approaches anything close to a generalized L2 has yet to be described let alone developed. Were still waiting for a basic description of how isomorphic state channels will ever scale dApps or have any use between untrusted parties. Hydras 2022 release schedule is for payment channels between trusted parties. Yes it will be able to handle smart contracts but not any smart contracts that dApps use. Hydra heads have to be closed every time a party joins or leaves and they have no known application for dApps. Hydra is really irrelevant because native UTXO transfers arent the problem right now. https//np.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/s18wie/should_cardano_be_prepared_to_abandon_hydra/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share**10. Off-chain computing**>Transactions occur outside of the blockchain itself yet can offer fast cheap transactions via a trust model.Brilliant. This is a creative solution. Off-chain **trusted** computations. *Finally something that makes sense.* Yes Cardano users should definitely do their computations somewhere they trust off-chain... Muhammad Fucking Christ. Let me suggest they do their computations on one of the 79 other L1 blockchains.Edit theres a massive difference between off-chain to a trusted party and off-chain to decentralized trustless rollup or side chain. They are not remotely the same. Thats why Sundaeswap had to come up with the convoluted scooper model and Maladex wrote a book detailing their experimental solution to countering the specific vulnerabilities of off-chain code (some of which on-chain verification will never detect). In the YouTube link above Sebastien from DC Spark says Cardano is years away from having rollups. **11. Mithril**>To achieve greater scalability you need to address the complexity of critical operations that depend logarithmically on the number of participants.  What? This is straight gibberish. Mithril is obviously not a relevant scaling solution. Mithril is a solution to a problem that many other chains dont even have. Even Ethereum can run a trustless lite client for nodes. Wtf does that have to do with how slow Cardano SCs are? Light client nodes dont write blocks in Cardano. Your inability to figure out a trustless lite client is irrelevant right now. **12. Fees**The short term consequence of Sundaeswaps launch will be a DDOS attack. Txs across the entire Cardano network will take days to process. I predict that Sundaeswap will be forced to throttle their volume so that the rest of the chain is usable. Best case scenario for EOY 2022 Cardano users can expect Ethereum L1 tx speeds if everything goes right.And Cardano has another problem they still havent solved that Ethereum doesnt have. Slow blockchains require high fees and Cardano doesnt have dynamic fees. Price fixing always creates shortages. They need dynamic fees. Theres no way around supply and demand. Everyone has been saying Cardanos fee model wouldnt work for years. IOHK is just now taking the question seriously and their recent moves on fees makes it clear that they have no idea what they are doing. People dont pay fees for fun. The fees are the only thing that make Ethereum usable. You can underpay gas on Ethereum and wait days for the tx to go through if you want but you cant manage Defi positions or even use a DEX without cutting in line to get immediate settlement. It doesnt matter that txs have a deterministic order. The Cardano chain cant compute every tx (off-chain) and magically update price feeds with future prices before the blocks are written. Even on Ethereum txs frequently fall outside of reasonable slippage in minutes. The slippage required to guarantee a tx over 24 hrs would regularly be a double digit percentage of the trade amount. And high slippage is especially a vulnerability for Cardano because so many dApps feature some risk of trusted party ordering. Low slippage is a protection against that.Also fees are how slow chains keep from getting Ddos attacked (RIP🏴‍☠️ NANO). If less than 13k txs take 24 hours to clear anyone can completely stop all traffic on the Cardano network for the cost of 13k txs. And they can render it functionally unusable for a fraction of that. The Cardano community has only recently begun to admit that priority fees will be necessary and their plans for tiered fees are poorly thought out. Search their sub for fees and read them blindly trying to reinvent the wheel. This is basic economics and they have done no real research on it. For years we were told that the whole point of Cardano was to avoid launching broken products like this. Cardanos reputation will never recover from this Move slow and break things for a food DEX (that originally chose to launch on BSC). ADA was worth more in 2018 than it was worth during its dip last week. What coin do you think ADA holders will have to sell to buy the other half of liquidity pairs to earn rewards on these DEXs? 🤔Cardano has not been waiting to release better designed more secure products. Txs that take days was not part of the 4d chess plan. Look at Sundaeswaps audit and the Plutus exploit. Its the same stuff we see on other chains plus slow txs plus trusted off-chain elements plus a roadmap that is critically reliant on problems that are unsolved. None of these problems are going away in weeks. The problem with Cardano is the complete lack of honesty from leaders and influencers like Charles Hoskinson who regularly makes false claims and a culture of over optimism and anti-critical thinking. Their plan isnt going well and their jobs rely on them not admitting it.,1209,0.7,1585,2022-01-19 12:56:04
How can I acquire moons as a lurker?,I like the idea of moons although there seems to be absolutely no use for them outside of getting special features in this sub? I also dont have much to contribute to the CC sub. I enjoy reading the discussions and seeing the panic/anger that ensues with the market fluctuations but besides upvoting I got nothing! Is there anything outside of posting/commenting that can help me get the moons that are highly sought after? Im not asking for a handout here. But the fact remains How can I go to the moon if I dont have any moons?,1208,0.87,1175,2022-02-03 23:11:39
Whats happening right now? A quick explanation,# What is going on right now?OK the price is low right now prices have been falling and the whole market is fearful. Some people much smarter than me would say that this the time to buy because this is when people get rich. Buy when there is blood on the street. Be greedy when others are fearful. Thats all good and well but for the rest of us that are fully invested - what the hell is happening?# The FedThe US federal reserve recently announced that they will begin hiking interest rates and tapering their purchases of securities - why does this affect cryptocurrencies? The current economic environment was one of extraordinary monetary policy. The money printer was on full throttle and interest rates were at near zero for a huge amount of time. What was the cost of this? inflation. Now that inflation is up the money printer has to be shut off and interest rates have to be hiked. This is bad news for companies with a lot of debt (like tech stocks with high future growth priced in). So traders hedge funds retail investors start cutting trades and taking profit. Also to fund their safer bets they need to sell riskier assets... its a risk off environment. So risk is coming off what is perceived as the riskiest asset out there? Cryptocurrencies. So we see trades unwind as people panic. For context this is not just SCLP or cryptocurrencies. At the time of writing NFLX is down 20%...&#x200B;[Risk off](https//preview.redd.it/0xv9rhv890d81.png?width=1326&format=png&auto=webp&s=123fcb75d5657b94cc30fbd290db5a83629f5753)The S&P has broken out of a long term channel ..&#x200B;[Left chart is S&P - which defines risk in the market bitcoin is a much smaller market and so follows in its wake.](https//preview.redd.it/rb7fw46e90d81.png?width=2754&format=png&auto=webp&s=0063b1a820fe2912fc41de401eb4b663ceb86f9c)&#x200B;# So what should I do?Ask yourself a few simple questions - what is my investment horizon? What is my long term view on cryptocurrencies and my chosen projects?You need to look for projects that are tangible. You need to look for projects that you believe in. If you are feeling a mental strain perhaps this is your first foray into the crypto markets - I would suggest making sure your investments are not too much for you to mentally handle. If you feel you are too at risk then rebalance into less risky assets. Buy some bonds which will do well in the increased interest rate environment. Then take a walk live your life. The markets are volatile they go up and they go down but fear wont control the market forever. Think about why you invested in the space in the first place and ask yourself has anything changed?# We are in this togetherYou are not alone. We will profit together and people will think that the journey there was so easy - but we have to suffer to get there which is something that the everyday person doesnt get.

This sub when prices go up They will go up forever 1M EOY. This sub when prices go down Its going to 10k I told you so.,Its just fascinating that this sub an actual sub that should support crypto is always putting in the biggest bearish sentiment and FUD. Anytime the prices go down everyone here panics and starts their I told you so. And put in targets of 10k. This sub is actually the place the most pessimistic about crypto prices.I get it that you dont want to have false hope and get shocked afterwards. But still you should prepare for the worst and hope for the best.And its the exact opposite when prices go up. Then they think its going to go up every day and forever. We are going to reach 100k in this run. Thats just not how it is green and red days are mixed up we wont straight up shoot to 100k or so. We will suffer for that.,1190,0.86,403,2022-01-24 08:15:13

Is Ethereum Still Worth the Investment? A deeper look.,&#x200B;### Ethereum2021 was a fantastic year for crypto in particular Ethereum. Ethereum reigns as **the second-largest blockchain** despite the slew of competition from Binance SC Solana Avalanche. But it remains far ahead showcased by various metrics and there are no signs of slowing down.#### Total Value Locked[*How to use TVL metrics*](https//medium.com/coinmonks/use-tvl-to-spot-the-next-hot-coin-crypto-market-update-12-28-dbae6020294a)Ethereum ended 2021 with a Total Value Locked (TVL) of $153 billion and contains nearly 60% of TVL in crypto. Its nearest competitor Terra (LUNA) TVL sits at $13.3b with 7% of the market. Despite the hype following emerging L1s they remain far from the king.&#x200B;https//preview.redd.it/blud071uo4f81.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e54dd093d848d7b55536a6f9daa638799116601 #### RevenueEthereum showcased impressive revenue in 2021 totaling $10.9b. The nearest L1 was BSC which edged on $1.0b of revenue. There are four projects on Ethereum that post larger revenue than BSC. (Filecoin Axie Opensea Uniswap)Opensea an NFT marketplace on Ethereum saw a revenue of $1.5b in 2021 with the emergence of NFTs.&#x200B;&#x200B;https//preview.redd.it/kkgktdovo4f81.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fc1a89d4b528841edba4038faf655798a8dc158 #### Layer 2s on EthereumLayer 2 protocols are taking traction benefitting from Ethereums **reliability and security**. In the future Ethereum may be a consensus layer for an extensive array of layer 2s that inherit low gas fees and fast TPS speeds.Some top names are Polygon (MATIC) Optimism Arbitrum Loopring (LRC) and ZkSync.#### Creator EarningsTypically creators on centralized networks like YouTube Spotify Etsy and OnlyFans only capture a portion of the revenue they create. As the creator economy on Ethereum begins to evolve many creators will start to see the benefits of capturing a larger percentage of value utilizing a decentralized network. NFTs for artists is a prime example. Ethereum as a whole competes with prominent names in creator economies.&#x200B;https//preview.redd.it/bj90vk8xo4f81.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=14b7da6a2f6ce455e71cba02cdddbd46535a31c1 #### Eth Burning and Deflationary PressuresEIP — 1559 upgrade has been burned 1.7 million ETHat a valuation of $4.6 billion since early Aug 2021. Before EIP-1559 all ETH would remain on the network. Now supply decreases with every transaction.&#x200B;https//preview.redd.it/p137lguyo4f81.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=177950e27231b4b6e071da3636bd78f1faa1757a Even though Ethereum remains inflationary the increasing demand sees days of negative issuance. With ETH continuously being locked away bought for speculation and utilized for gas fees Ethereums deflationary pressures will exceed new supply. &#x200B;https//preview.redd.it/b9548ab0p4f81.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=33d952ac0f6b1adc67a4015195e051ad01038bfd&#x200B; #### ConclusionEthereum remains far ahead of its competition in almost all metrics. [Moreover it attracted the highest number of developers in 2021](https//medium.com/coinmonks/electric-capital-developer-report-recap-where-are-the-crypto-developers-going-and-why-its-3855aa5dd1d8) that continue to build the ecosystem.There are a few negatives for Ethereum no doubt. Ethereum is slow and gas fees are incredibly high. In addition environmental mandates are beginning to add pressure to the proof of work consensus. But Ethereum contains scheduled upgrades that will improve speed lower gas fees and see a switch to an eco-friendly proof of stake. Ethereum Consensus Network (formerly Eth 2.0) will be near completion in approximately one year.So what are we left with?* The largest and fastest-growing ecosystem in crypto*  Significant deflationary pressures* The emergence of Layer 2 options *  Dwindling supply*  Hammered down ETH prices*  Upcoming improvement upgrades to the network*  The emergence of creator economy (NFTS DAOs music writers games)[Its no wonder Cathie Wood and her team of quants forecast an ETH price of 180k by 2030](https//www.nasdaq.com/articles/cathie-wood%3A-ethereum-will-reach-%2420-trillion-market-cap-by-2030).2022 will be an important year for [Ethereum upgrades](https//etherworld.co/2021/12/02/ethereums-latest-roadmap/). In the past upgrades are often delayed and I expect no different this time. But the process seldom detriments the network. So…At its current price of $2680 Ethereum could be a complete steal **and far as the risk/reward ratio it remains one of the best crypto investments**.&#x200B; ### Gabi*Follow me on*  [*Medium*](https//medium.com/@TraderGabi) *or subscribe to this FREE daily newsletter on* [*Substack*](https//tradergabi.substack.com/) *to receive it first!*,1184,0.9,699,2022-02-01 01:59:51

Stop Gatekeeping Crypto Adoption,The salty highly upvoted post mocking dogecoin being accepted at Tesla for some items - the sixth largest company in the world in market cap and undoubtedly one of the most visible companies in the world accepting the purchase of items with cryptocurrency - priced in cryptocurrency and not fiat - is absolutely disgraceful. It shows what this sub is - not an advocate for cryptocurrency but a thinly veiled place to be tribal and act salty when other peoples bags do well.Thats pathetic.This is a win for cryptocurrency in general. Ive been around this space since 2013. Back then Bitcoiners were screaming for companies to accept cryptocurrency and price things in cryptocurrency. Then when it happens 8 years later the primary attitude about it is salt just because the cryptocurrency of choice isnt in the bag of certain people in the sub.Grow up take a step back and recognize this as a win for cryptocurrency. We are in this together.If it was your cryptocurrency of preference being accepted youd magically consider it a good thing. Thats the truth.Note My bad this is a remade post - the original was closed as I shared it on my Twitter which I have found is against this subreddits rules.,1177,0.83,1162,2022-01-15 18:46:03
IT IS GOING TO BE OKAY! In 2018 my portfolio was down 90%. It took 2 years to really take back off. For most of us you havent lost money unless you sell.,**Disclaimer** This only really applies to those of you that have done their best to invest the majority of their money into safer crypto projects. If youre freaking out because you YOLOd your savings into Dogelonmars42069 then yeah you might have to learn a few hard lessons.For the rest of you who have done their best to invest in more time proven projects like BTC/ETH its time to buckle up relax and wait for this all to blow over. Freaking out and panic selling to save a fraction of your investment wont help your future self. Nobody knows anything. This might be a blip or a bear market. The best way to last in this space is to take a breather zoom out and realize eventually everything is gonna be alright. Success does not happen overnight.**If youre freaking out now because you made some bad investments or over-extended yourself use this time as a learning opportunity.** I am not a crypto wizard. I made every mistake a newbie could make. Back in 2017-18 you could buy crypto with credit cards lol. But what I hope Im conveying is that if you hold onto your coins youll most likely come out ahead eventually. In 2018 was so depressed and mad at myself I just uninstalled my apps and didnt look at my crypto until 2020. But then it got better and most of the projects I invested in back then started doing well again. If I had sold and not weathered the dip I wouldve been even more angry at myself.Remember to take time for yourself. Stop staring at reddit and charts all day.

The concept of NFTs is valuable. But a JPEG is not worth millions of dollars.,In fact I dont think these JPEGs should be valued for more than 5 digits. And most of the time its not the market thats setting these prices. Theyre usually inorganically inflated.This is exactly why NFT like Bored Apes are so hated. I think the only valuable thing about Bored Apes is the access to exclusive places and contacts but thats it.Even then I think this exclusivity is REALLY inflated when there are NFTs like Habtoors Last Hopium offering almost the same services and exclusivity for much less.I dont want to use the word bubble cause NFT do in fact have a lot of applications later on.

The IRS may not tax crypto earned through staking! The Jarret case involving Tezos may set the precedent.,In May of last year Josh and Jessica Jarrett requested a refund of income tax they paid on Tezos staking rewards in 2019. (Around $3200 for approximately 8800 Tezos tokens)Today the IRS has decided to issue that refund. They will not refund any amount that was sold obviously but the couple is getting refunded for the entire amount requested the tax they paid on the rewards that they did not sale. This could be huge for everyone involved in cryptocurrency. The records will be made public Thursday and **the IRS has not made any public statements**. **Source Blockworks .com**   **forbes .com**The Jarrett couple argued that new coins are tax-payer created property and should not be taxed until sold or exchanged. ##Edit For those that are unfamiliar the IRS views cryptocurrency as property a capital asset.  There are two methods of taxation capital gains tax and income tax. ##When you sell trade or dispose of a capital asset you incur **capital gains tax**. ##When you receive crypto through staking rewards mining airdrops the IRS views that as income and its subject to **income tax** just like interest you earn on fiat in a traditional bank. ##You owe income tax on it whether you sell or not. ##This is what is in question taxing something that has not been sold or traded only created.,1138,0.96,648,2022-02-03 00:50:38
A Bitcoin Death Cross is coming up. Just a reminder that there was a Golden Cross a few months ago that led to huge dip. These Technical indicators really mean nothing.,So once again [we have a Death Cross looming in the Bitcoin chart.](https//www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/10/bitcoin-approaches-death-cross-as-goldman-foresees-4-fed-rate-hikes-this-year/) This is a bearish indicator that occurs when the 50 day MA dips below the 200 day MA. I just want to remind everyone that these indicators dont really mean anything and that they shouldnt be trusted.

The government says crypto has no value but theyre still taxing us…,When you consider what politicians the SEC and bankers have to say about crypto it should be evident that according to them they have no value and are regarded as a worthless and a useless asset… but theyre still taxing us on crypto. When it comes to value they probably didnt understand the ecosystem and use cases of (not shitcoins) crypto.For someone like me I did a lot of trading and utilized a lot of different exchanges and wallets (which of course wasnt a good idea).I also use a coin tracker and records to keep track of my gains and losses. I started with [Koinly](https//koinly.io/?r=1) but because I didnt want to pay for the tax reports I switched to [Crypto.com](https//crypto.com/?r=1) and their tax tool. I experienced the same problem with both of them. I then discovered that [CryptoTaxCalculator](http//cryptotaxcalculator.io/?r=1) was a lot more accurate at recognizing transactions than Koinly.But seriously though this just makes government bankers and politicians hypocrites if they make people pay taxes on crypto if they consider it a useless asset and that theyll receive a part of their paycheck from taxes collected from crypto. To have intrinsic value something does not have to be a physical asset like gold or have official government support or acknowledgment. From a philosophical and practical standpoint the whole argument that it has no intrinsic worth is a ridiculous slippery slope.,1127,0.87,816,2022-01-26 06:29:32

Flash Crash Warning!,**TLDR**[F.U.D. Courtesy of The Fed](https//i.redd.it/lnne0752iwe81.gif)A LOT has changed since NOV ATHs....We sit on the edge of a Bear Market in many assets and have a new 8000lb Gorilla in the room (a hawkish FED that um day trades).Meanwhile crypto has recently correlated with the VIX (-94% on Friday) so now the SPX and Crypto are joined at the hip[ATHs in VIX Correlation](https//preview.redd.it/dyrvahorewe81.png?width=722&format=png&auto=webp&s=74c66bf65f603426cfd18723b4e169d7a6c91006)Whats interesting here is how much the order book has dried up. The book is running very thin (that trend is ongoing) which means that prices can bounce a lot more then would otherwise be the case. It also means that prices will likely come under even more pressure (high volatility does not support price increases in the average asset) in the short term.Additionally this set up may create some extra wild price swings that may whack the over leveraged margin & futures traders. How that will affect Exchange Operability remains to be seen-but lets just say it wont help them stay more stable. ***;)***Here are some charts that help illustrate the problem they look like  Rorschach (ink blot) Tests[S&P Book Depth Is Shrinking...see that flash crash point in DEC Week 1?](https//preview.redd.it/2322juyfewe81.png?width=925&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6deb7aa59f8cde5abc8249b93b7a51836556e5e)[Nasdaq Book Depth Is Shrinking...](https//preview.redd.it/18u5bnxhfwe81.png?width=950&format=png&auto=webp&s=c185674b9ffbcb996c7d8b516ff4e4a11e2b351c)[Bid/Ask Spread is HUGE here.....](https//preview.redd.it/o6npfgawfwe81.png?width=929&format=png&auto=webp&s=aaad2c1a72e6971e9823ad5ea853510216f968f8)These are indications that volatility is likely to remain significantly elevated in the days ahead-atop a level that is already very high. ***This also suggests that the price declines we have seen in the cryptoverse correction are not over.*** Whats more January is usually one of the most chill months for volatility-so the fact that we are already running high in a normally chill month-is note worthy here[January is supposed to be chill bro......but aint!](https//preview.redd.it/119pzsqogwe81.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e4c3e50abe9504ee6c7d6a7d1229d95a079cdae)Here is a chart of Volatility and Volatility of Volatility overlaid[The VIX is Now Trending Up Up Up and away......](https//preview.redd.it/yzuib1g1qwe81.png?width=1150&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f83eee07ec3b8e4261700eb6921d814bf17c711)At present volatility is retreating off its highs but the trend is clear-and that trend is UP. Volatility is now bullish trend where for all of 2021 it was not. That is a huge sea change. As long as the correlation to the VIX remains as titanium strong as it is at present *this suggests that prices will remain under pressure for quite some time.* (No Virginia Coin #1 will not be hitting $100k any time soon-as in this year dear.)Meanwhile the book is thinning to where it was at the December Flash crash.....ruh roh!**I am not a chicken little and I am not given to fear.

Teach a man how to stake and he shall enjoy passive income for the rest of his time,There are a lot of people who buy and only HODL your coins and tokens. This post is for those of you that do.What is staking? Staking is a mechanic where you lock up your cryptos and generate passive income as you are helping to secure the blockchain through said mechanic. So you dont have to do anything and you can generate passive income through staking. This is just like interest in banks but only with much better APY. Lets say I have 32 ETH and I am staking them for a 6% APY. So 32 ETH x 6% = 1.92 ETHThat gives you 1.92 ETH for free by staking every year. There are many coins that let you stake. BTC doesnt let you stake but you can lend it out to generate some passive income. Generally the APY for staking is around 5% give or take. Some provide more some provide less.

They are blocking internet connection cause they are on edge of civil war…,And surprise you need internet for crypto…&#x200B;Coming from a person living in Lebanon (a country on the verge of political economical and civil collapse) I can tell you that only a self centered asshole will look at whats going on Kazakhstan and just think of Bitcoin.&#x200B;Theyre having much bigger problems than mining I can assure you that.&#x200B;And if you really want to bring crypto into it this might be the chance for alts to finally decouple from BTC.&#x200B;Its slowly but surely happening and I already bought some DeFi alts like Curve cause I think its the best DeFi project and some BitDAO considering how much theyve been investing in the DeFi space recently.&#x200B;Many are the times that BTC has ruined an uptrend cause it went down 0.01%. So this might actually be good for the market long term if you all care about is crypto in this humanitarian disaster…,1092,0.94,269,2022-01-13 16:26:36

Dead cat bounce rebound or start of pump can we have a moment of silence for all those that sold yesterday who absolutely knew that the crypto market was going to drop forever,Title says it all really the markets are absolutely racing upwards today. Maybe a rebound maybe a dead cat bounce maybe a rally maybe just a small pull back we dont know.Nothing has changed from last week so dont be surprised if the markets continue going back down again tomorrow especially with the heightened political tensions in Europe at the moment as well as the threat of inflation increasing scaring the larger market investors out for now.However no matter what the future holds today saw an amazing rally upwards and everyone that sold yesterday must be hating themselves. Especially for some alts that are pushing into the 30% range thats almost 3 years of stocks growth right there in 24 hours!The last month has really shown us yet again that shorting / leveraging / day trading crypto can make you some pocket change here and there but you miss one key swing and youre out on the streets with nothing.,1075,0.82,1100,2022-01-25 11:21:17

People made a lot of money because they invested when the market was down not when it was on ATH, I know there are a lot of posts like this and mine doesnt stand out compared to the others. Nobody enjoys when the market crashes but I just want to say that this is the time when serious investors are entering with a lot of money. Of course we all know that this is a very volatile market and that in a few days the price may fall even lower but that is why there is DCA.In any case I have an opinion that it is not necessary to invest your sum of money at once but to spread it over a certain period of time. Honestly Im not too worried about prices dropping I think that this is a technology that will keep on living but with projects that have a real world use. Cheers and good luck to all.,1062,0.92,458,2022-01-23 14:03:59

Settlement in real time means that payment transaction does not require any waiting period. The transactions are settled as soon as they are processed. Gross settlement means the transaction is settled on one to one basis without bunching or netting with any other transactionComparatively ACHs are typically used for low-value non-urgent transactions while RTGS systems are typically used for high-value urgent transactions[https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_system](https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_system)&#x200B;Think of all those poor clearing houses and companies getting a % cut that will be wiped out._________Get ready for craziness and cheap crypto.I am buying up all privacy coins Monero Dash etc as an investmentLearn how to use a VPN Linux is your friend ( Microsoft snitches) and encryption doesnt hurt._____EditTO all those upset about politics when politics comes after my crypto....

Im Shocked How Against Crypto Reddit as a Whole is Outside of Crypto Subs,At times it feels like crypto is being pretty widely accepted by the general public we see guys like Mark Cuban and Elon Musk adopting it for their companies many mainstream companies like Charmin and Taco Bell are getting into the NFT game and at times its a mainstream media darling when its doing well.I would expect Reddit to be equally if not more supportive of crypto than the general public or that I might expect to see from say in a comments section on Yahoo News however when I see Bitcoin or Crypto mentioned in more mainstream Reddit subs like r/news or others everyone seems to be talking shit about crypto bros or making references to Beanie Babies its kind of crazy to me as Reddit tends to sku younger and be very tech friendly. Heres some of the types of comments Im talking about and these are like handpicked comments this sentiment seems to be the majority.Looks like Cryptobros will have to go back to Amway.Pyramid schemeAnyone who thinks the worlds governments and central banks are going to allow unregulated virtual currency to take over is dillusional.Lets pretend a speculative asset masquerading as the most deflationary currency ever is the future of finance.

Help me understand the recent market turnaround,I am sitting here trying to understand and rationalize the market rebound and I have come to the conclusion that I have no idea why the market is trending back upwards. Was there something in particular that can be attributed to the turnaround? Just not sure where all the current resilience and market confidence is coming from.I have been hesitant ever since it was signaled that there would be an announcement from the White House on how they wanted to enforce rules around crypto as a matter of national security.

Diamond hands isnt just a meme anyone who held on to their coins during the eoy 2021 crash was and will be rewarded in 2022,People tend to forget and lose sight very fast. Many say diamond hands  slightly but yet they lose hope fast and panic sell.This was just a month and few days ago when the end of year 2021 crash happend and many people already panic sold their coins.If they had hold onto it most of them has been recovered. It is just a matter of time when their investment doesnt just recover but will turn into big profit.We invest in crypto keyword  **Invest**.If you are in cryptoverse just for the gamble by buying shitcoins you can go to the casino instead...this isnt called investing.But if you invest you had did DYOR and diversify your portfolio.Time will tell the true diamond hands will be the ones taking the best profit.In the stock market for example buying ETFs you need at least to invest in a timeframe of 15 years to get some halfway decent gains.In crypto everything is so accelerated people lose sight in just 1 month.,1010,0.81,920,2022-02-06 12:16:27

Loopring has been steadily dumping with no bottom in sight and nobody is talking about it,It seems pretty clear the exponential price action last year was all based on hype surrounding GME rumours there was no actual substance to it therefore the price isnt holding up. The market cap to TVL ratio is still high at 4.5 so I dont see this downtrend ending anytime soon without any new catalysts. If you compare this to another hyped coin like CRO which saw a meteoretic rise and whos price has stabilized since then (especially if you look at the CRO/BTC pair) you can see that LRC is nowhere near a bottom. I could easily see Loopring dropping below $1 again assuming no significant BTC movements happen.And yet all I see on this sub is more threads shilling the coin and doses of hopium about the long term potential? Nobody is seriously discussing price action over the last two months which is a huge concern to me. Im not arguing that Loopring is a dead project far from it but the short term price prospects are very meagre. Everyone should decide what to do for themselves i.e. risk management but I dont see any value in bagholding it when theres no end in sight for the downwards trend.Dont get me wrong I see huge potential in ZK roll ups and in particular LRC for the next five years eventhough I dont own it myself. In fact Im looking for this downtrend to end so I can buy it when it eventually consolidates. Since Loopring is by far the most shilled coin on this sub  I feel bad for the ones that FOMOd in after the price rise in early November. These people are seeing their gains evaporate like snow in the sun or are suffering big losses. Maybe an announcement by Gamestop at the end of this month or during the next earnings call will stop this downtrend but I dont see it stopping anytime soon before that.EDIT To anyone commenting that price doesnt matter well it does. Let me put it this way if LRC is $1.35 and you feel like it will move below $1 in the short term you should absolutely sell because you can increase your holdings for the long term with 35%EDIT 2 Obviously DCAing is also an option when the price drops I would wait until the price stabilizes thoughEDIT 3 Since I received the suicide care message from Reddit and multiple threats in my inbox I will no longer interact with this thread. What a shame that people cant behave.,998,0.69,1417,2022-01-16 17:57:56
If youre kicking yourself for not buying more during the crash stop. This is how FOMO begins.,Stick to your original plan. And if you dont have one try to establish one - even if its a simple DCA system without much more of an end goal than eventually having more money. Dont get caught up in the hype which is very rapidly flooding into every persons social media feed. The success of broader crypto and the individual projects themselves is not going to be decided in a few days; and if a projects success is solely confined to a small number of green candles then its probably not going to last long; look at its user base its pipeline its developers. Of course if the plan is to trade in the short term look for trends to capitalise of off; but if you are simply looking for a longer term investment look beyond a bull market (if this is one). Therell be plenty more green periods to look forward to if crypto truly comes to be adopted at the rate and to the extent it seems it will.,987,0.91,350,2022-02-07 20:11:18
Yes we are early in crypto. But not $1000 in BTC will make me a millionaire early.,Saying that we are early in crypto is not totally true if you are a new investor thinking that with $1000 in BTC you will become a millionaire in next couple of years. We are not that early and I hate when people are leaving that imperssion on new investors.We are early from perspective of crypto and blockchain as a technology that can really change some things in nowadays financial world and world as a whole.However holding coins that are standing strong like BTC and ETH in this highly volatile market is lowering your risk and in some way saving your money because they will stick with us for a long time. But you are not late. If you invested in any top10 coins in the begining of 2021 you would be in profit in each of it even BCH.Also if you invested last year in coins like MATIC FTM SOL and held it your profits would go x1000.You need to be very smart and very lucky to choose a right coin with a good project and after you do that you need to hold it while it goes up and that is a thing of masterpiece. But no you wont get rich with $1000 in BTC we are not that early.,976,0.9,852,2022-01-17 09:42:14
Intel announces that its entering the Bitcoin mining market,The ISCCC Conference is one of the most prestigious events in the chip industry. At this years conference Intel is set to outline a new Bonanza Mine processor a new chip described as an ultra-low-voltage energy-efficient Bitcoin mining ASIC.This means that they will soon compete with the likes of Bitmain in the market for specialized ASICs for Bitcoin mining.Last year Intels Systems and Graphics Architect Senior Vice President and GM Raja Koduri said this about crypto mining*Being able to do much more efficient blockchain validation at a much lower cost much lower power is a pretty solvable problem.

Calling everything in crypto a coin is going to be this generations calling every game console a Nintendo,Title says it all the 90s were dominated by a singular games console the Nintendo to the point where they had almost the entire market share of the home video games field. It go the point where Nintendo became THE word for a games console for those that had only a passing knowledge of the subject.Fast forward to today and bitcoin is the new Nintendo it has owned and still owns the lions share of the crypto market. Most people have heard of it and probably think all crypto IS just bitcoin. Now people refer to everything as a coin no matter what it actually is.The next generation are going to be making memes about us here in the present not knowing the difference between a v2000 utility chip and a micro contract smart tokeniser is and instead calling them both coins while trying to tell them that back in my day we didnt need any of this new age fancy stuff.&#x200B;Edit Im sure it wont be long before NFTs are called coins as well.,977,0.87,709,2022-01-11 14:47:20

Filing taxes for Crypto makes me not want to trade crypto.,This past year I did a lot of crypto trading. I used a lot of different exchanges and within each exchange did quite a few trades. Having to go through each exchange go through all the history figure out the cost basis is kinda a pain and now having to go back through all of it makes me not want to trade. Then on top of that the forms you need to fill out 1099- NEC 8949 plus stuff on your actually return. Yes it was nice making some money (and losing some lol) but after going through all this work only to pay the Gov more money that they will just misuse is a little disheartening.Anyway just wanted to vent a little.,977,0.94,1099,2022-02-03 02:02:36
Why I believe we are all still a decade early to crypto.,This post is a serious one I made after reading this article. [ [https//moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html](https//moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html) ] >Shout out to Moxie for actually talking about how shit has just become super overcomplicated for coders to even begin to get into. This article is probably the best critique of the current crypto space Ive ever read ^We have these ideas of immutable trustless decentralized platforms but most of them have become mutable and centralized with all trust put in the hands of a few servers.Cardano for example the fact that [sundaeswap took 6 months to release and its not even fully ready yet](https//cryptosrus.com/cardstarter-and-sundaeswap-a-falling-out-story/) …[plus looking like they rugged cardstarter](https//coin.fyi/news/cardano/cardstarter-and-every-single-project-it-has-launched-smells-of-a-scam-nmrfpt) its not a good look!Trustless doesnt make sense when theres still just a team of greedy humans on the other end of single phone line. I recall when my friends where first getting into crypto a few months ago best believe it wasnt *‘for the tech* it was pure greed they were aping hundreds into doggy coins hoping to make millions out of thin air. Arweave which was made to solve the issue of NFTs being backed by on centralized servers is still putting trust in the hands of others so its not exactly trustless and things can still be flagged for deletion and stuff like that. [https//www.arweave.org/technology](https//www.arweave.org/technology)  = *Finally those that maintain gateways (the servers you will likely use to view the permaweb) can also apply content moderation policies to further safeguard their users.*Its tricky though like if you have permanent jpeg storage on a truly immutable permanent server what about criminal abuse material and other fed up stuff like that from being put on there ‘for good? Thats why Arweave has a democratic processes for removal of content if its deemed necessary but the problem is its SLOW! Just like Cardano just like ETH and Bitcoin Dogecoin and so on.

To conclude this spiel **I think were about a decade away from this all.** Till then I am still having fun learning about money economics fiancé decentralization issues network effects but less and less am I feeling married to any single current network/blockchain because they all seem to be unable to carry the load that will weigh on future technological shoulders.,960,0.87,541,2022-02-05 09:58:11
I dont think the crypto.com-hack shows that you should definitely not keep any crypto on exchanges - but weirdly enough rather the opposite?,By now weve all heard about the crypto.com hack. About 12 hours ago they tweeted that a small number of users reported suspicious activity on their accounts and that they would disable withdrawals for a bit just to be safe. Just ten minutes ago they tweeted Update Withdrawal services have been restored. All funds are safe.I personally have never used crypto.com specifically and therefore have no money on there. But honestly if this had happened to one of the exchanges I use (I wont say which because its not about that but I use two of the big ones and have a relevant amount of money for me on each of them) I wouldnt have been worried at all. Big exchanges have insurance have most of their funds in cold wallets and especially a very public exchange like crypto.com couldnt afford the PR disaster of not refunding their customers if it was even remotely their own fault.Ive seen a few posts and many comments saying that this proves you should never trust an exchange with cour crypto. But looking at how they reacted - immediately disabling withdrawals communicating openly etc. - and considering they **have** to react this way to avoid a PR disaster - I think if this shows anything its rather the opposite if you have a good password and 2FA most likely its totally fine to leave your coins and tokens on one of the big trustworthy exchanges.Im not saying you should not use your own wallet for many people thats the better solution. But especially if youre new youre much more likely to send your coins to nirvana or to lose your private keys than you are to lose your funds if you leave them on the exchange.Im pretty sure yall will hate this opinion but I wanted to get it off my chest.

This is the best thing to happen to crypto for a while,Yes you read my title right. this market crash and burn is the best thing to happen to crypto for a while.sure most of us are down over 30%. sure it sucks seeing your investment of hard earned money (or not in some cases) capitulate.however that being said the joy of watching all the armchair experts who have been in the space for 5 minutes lose their shit is simply priceless. call me evil an a hole machiavellian or whatever. but I am enjoying this moment of big old humble pie. crypto has been trending towards a meme just another fad in pop culture. something you become a part of cos its cool not because of the tech disruption or any logical reason.we are going to see a lot of noobs and dweebs get cleared out from this space. we are also going to see a lot of scam coins shitcoins and downright terrible project disappear for the better.this is the massive clean up we have needed for some time. the markets and I mean ALL markets have been frothing for some time now.if you truly understand and believe in crypto you will stay and I will see you in 6 months time on the other side.to all the obnoxious morons who thought they were so clever getting into crypto for the culture GOODBYE!!! and good riddance.,955,0.83,407,2022-01-22 09:46:13

I suggest not trying to learn technical analysis its a fake science and a bad art.,TA tries to capture market psychology and sentiment by analyzing price trends and chart patterns for possible trading opportunities but its misguided and lacks a theoretical basis.         When put to scientific tests it doesnt hold up against empirical evidence. Analysts consistently looking at different indicators and hedge their analysis. Often going BACK to data and drawing lines saying LOOK LOOK it broke the barrier line trend hill thing! SEE!           Listen - if this stuff actually worked - we would have giant AI computers dedicated to learning how to do it - oh thats right we do - and you know what happens when we plug them in to the system? The system figures it out and reacts differently. The global mood changes on a dime and all TA goes out the door with it.         **tldr; IT IS NOT OBJECTIVE.**         Let me be clear there ARE definite patterns within the stock market and if they are recognized they can be successfully traded upon but analyst cannot separate themselves from their beliefs and pre-dispositions they selectively and possibly sub-consciously choose charts and TA indicators that confirm what they have already concluded.,946,0.76,657,2022-02-07 12:59:28
The Web3/Ethereum community is currently divided by a culture war. Heres an easy-to-understand recap.,Since last weekend the Ethereum community has been torn apart by an unprecedented culture war. Two camps have formed and there is no indication that they will find common ground anytime soon. I will not take side with this post as I only want to inform people of this issue.**So... What exactly is going on?**One of the pillars of the Web3 movement is the Ethereum Naming Service (ENS). This is a way to associate a public address with an easy-to-remember address; rather than telling your friend to send ether to you at 0x1234abcd... for example you tell them to send that to yourname.eth. It may not matter much today but this protocol is a part of the foundation on which much of Web3 is built.One of ENSs most influential developers Brantly Millegan has made some very controversial tweets about homosexuality trans people masturbation and pornography. Brantly is a practicing Catholic and he has stated that all of these things are evil.People in the community asked him to withdraw his words and apologize which he refused.**Why did the situation escalate?**Soon two camps were formed.On the one hand those who believe that Brantly can say whatever he wants since it is his freedom of speech. These people do not necessarily endorse his positions but they defend his right to express them. They argue that the essence of Web3 is permissionless. In their view nobody should be cancelled for their personnal beliefs.On the other hand there are those who believe that Brantly views are dangerous and hurtful to members of the community who are gay transgender or who use pornography. They are afraid that as a public figure in the Web3 community Brantly will scare away a lot of people with his opinions.We have all the ingredients for a good old-fashioned wokeness versus free speech conflict.**What are the consequences of the dispute?**Brantly was removed from his position by the organization that manages ENS. Some of the free speech fringe reacted by selling their ENS tokens and some even gave up their .eth domain entirely.On its side the woke fringe hopes that such incidents will not happen again. They are gathered under the name ENS is for everyone and they militate for Web3 to be a safe space for everyone.**Whats next?**I dont know and nobody knows. But this first culture war is a great test to determine the values of Web3. Do we want it to be a bastion of free speech or do we want it to be a welcoming place for everyone? The next few weeks are gonna be interesting thats for sure.Thanks for reading and I hope you learned something from me today! What do you think about all this?EDIT  *Please be respectful in your comments the discussion will be of better quality that way.*,943,0.84,1044,2022-02-08 15:23:23

I do believe that CRO has finally delivered what the average person needs to get into crypto which is simple real world usage,I want to point out that Im not shilling CRO I have a tiny bag of it not even enough to get the first tier of their debit card. I also want to add that they are far from perfect their app is so ridiculously slow and I hate that I have to use a mobile phone instead of a desktop both drive me mad. Also I know its not decentralised so a lot of the crypto purists are not going to like it (even though no crypto coin where you can just buy a controlling quantity with the only limitation being having enough money was never truly decentralised in my opinion).&#x200B;That said I think they have structured their business model perfectly towards the average person1) You need to have almost zero knowledge to buy CRO and stake it.2) Their pre paid debit card is the best bridge Ive seen so far between fiat and crypto you just spend your fiat and get crypto in return. It doesnt require all the worlds companies to change their payment systems and pricing structure. Everything stays in fiat and the user gets the reward. Also it looks super cool and makes people want to show it off.3) Their daily missions encourage a repeating $20 daily DCA which is perfect for teaching new investors to put in gradually and repeatedly rather than dumping a 4/5 digit lump sum all in on one price point often near ATHs.4) They offer decent staking rewards although you do need a large bag of CRO to access it which I feel is a bit off-putting.5) They are doing real marketing buying stadiums and paying Matt Damon to be in their adverts. Compare that to someone like LRC who also have a fait on ramp and wallet system and their marketing consists of a guy posting laser eye memes on twitter and discord and saying things like WAGMI. I know Matt Damon was just paid to be in an advert but I still trust any company that can actually afford to hire him far more than a company that cannot / will not spend that money.  6) The coin price point is something that retail can understand its not a scary large number like BTC but its also not 6 0s after a decimal like a lot of shitcoins.7) Their model is built around buying and holding their coin for other rewards which is again great at teaching retail to HODL rather than the only means of value to try and sell at a higher price point that pretty much the rest of the crypto market exists on.,936,0.85,1303,2022-01-13 11:27:40
Why so much hate for Cordano?,HiIt is strange how many in here bash cardano. I mean if someone wants free moons you can title your post cardano is overrated and a flood of praises will follow.Cardano has many advantages comparing to other L1 projects1. Academic team who are actively researching new horizons and publishing papers.2. Novel double layer architecture.3. It has Great security.4.it is extremely sustainable and environment friendly.5. It almost entirely decentralized.6. It is one of the few top projects with low share of its coins in the hands of whales (if I remember more than 80% was owned by small hodlers).7. transaction are fast and very cheap.8. An increasing number of developers are using its blockchain.For all it this pros and many more the only cons I heard about is the recent congestion which almost any crowded blockchain experienced so far. People forgive ETH for practically everything but cardano is bad because of a congestion? Or because it didnt grow much in market value? Or is it another reason which I missed? Like annoying fan base?I really think ADA doesnt deserve so much hate. It is a solid project with a really nice team and it might have a bright future ahead of it.Vve,920,0.73,1256,2022-01-25 06:51:41
Blockfi Horrible Loan Experience (FORTUNE Lost),Took out a loan for $300K and put up 600K worth of BTC as collateral. Market kept going down so I kept posting collateral as needed to keep the loan healthy.&#x200B;I got an email saying that the loan was being called back because of indirect exposure to a mixing service&#x200B;I appealed the decision because I bought the BTC back in May of 2020 and kept it on my Trezor the entire time. However since I didnt buy it on an exchange and the person before me mixed it (BISQ) I get absolutely screwed.&#x200B;In summary I took out a loan when BTC was 65000 Cost me over $6000 in origination fees paid two months of loan payments ($2500+) got liquidated at $37000 a few MINUTES before a pump to $42000 today because of indirect mixing exposure and now I lost more than half of my BTC holdings have a huge tax bill and was screwed out of a fortune.&#x200B;DO NOT USE BLOCKFI LOANS. Worst experience I have ever had in Bitcoin&#x200B;&#x200B;EDIT Since everybody keeps saying Dont take loans to buy crypto I am adding this comment to the main postMy bank did not consider BTC as an asset. I took out the loan with the intention of showing the balance in my bank account so I can get the mortgage and was planning on paying off the loans to get my BTC back.Didnt work out......&#x200B;&#x200B;EDIT 2 Most importantly the main problem for me was the P2P nature of the transaction. They literally do not allow you to buy your BTC from any private source that does not perform KYC.

In this thread i will tell you what you need to know. You may not like it but its important if you want to level up.***INTRODUCTION**Forget everything you think you know about cryptocurrency. You need to realise crypto is a game. A game where most likely you will lose. A game filled with players with more experience than yourself. Players with far more influence connection and often skill. The inconvenient truth is we arent all ‘gonna make it Beyond Bitcoin & some credible projects there are countless failed ones. Some projects have good intentions but are grossly overvalued. Others are quite simply scams & money grabs.But before you get angry at me & stop reading. Before you heckle ‘FUD or ‘Youre Not Gonna Make It. Let me explain myself.Yes crypto is filled with scams & scammers but there is big money to be made. But only IF you understand how the rules of this game work & how to play it successfully. At the moment  many of you are playing the game blindfolded. Giving others the upperhand. Thats why for this first post I will pull back the curtain. And reveal the rules of the game. The rules many dont want you to know. If youve been in the game for a while you may know some of them. If youre new read it twice and let it all sink in.Why am I doing this? Why am I revealing these secrets? Because before I teach you anything you need to know how this game works. You need to know these rules if you want to have a chance at actually winning. Because if you want to win this game you must first know how it is played.So you have two choices in front of you do you want to learn the truth & get better.Or do you want to carry on hopiuming for the best**THE FIVE SECRET RULES****1 BE WARY OF INFLUENCERS**Anyone who has been in crypto for more than six months will likely be aware of the first rule. Many of you will have been wrecked by a big YouTube influencer who shilled you some random alt coin. You were told it would x100 you aped in & now its down 80%. Dont be embarrassed or ashamed of this. To tell you the truth the same happened to me. In fact it was the best thing that ever happened to me. It taught me to actually do my own research think for myself & find good people to teach me.Yes there are good people in this crypto game (ill share some at the bottom of this article) but you need to understand many are not your friend & they dont care about your bags. The problem is actually much bigger than you realize too. Many of the biggest YouTube influencers collude together in private telegram groups. They work together to hunt coins with a low market cap & volume ones that can easily be pumped (and then dumped) in price. They work together to cut deals on new crypto projects and ensure their bags get filled before anyone else. Only to dump on their ‘fans down the line. Do you think its a confidence that MoonCarl worked with BitBoy Crypto Banter MM Crypto & Lark Davies to shill Kasta? I think not.But influencer xx is different  I hear you cry. Well maybe you got lucky & found a good one. Yet even then you need to be careful. Because if the person has millions of followers on YouTube they may still invertedly pump the price as their followers ape in. Like it or not you need to be weary of big YouTube influencers. They arent your friend & they dont care about your god damn bags.**2 BE CAUTIOUS OF BAD PROJECTS**Some projects will ‘make it & usher in a new store value (Bitcoin) Economies (L1s) Defi gaming (Play2Earn) & digital ownership (NFTs). However most projects wont. Some projects will have good intentions and create a token to fund an exciting vision. But even then you have to ask the question…if the idea is so good & so financially lucrative why are they willing to give up so much equity? Would you give up guaranteed money in a lucrative project? I think not. Yes some are committed to a decentralized future but they are few and far between.Much worse is a bunch of less honorable ‘founders and ‘VCs that spotted an opportunity for a quick cash grab. These folks mainly from a sales background realized pretty quickly that they could get very rich (with very little effort) by doing an ICO and marketing the hell out of it. Their primary business objective isnt to build a decentralized future its simply to market the hell out of a project and dump their bags on newbies. You need to tell who are the good VCs and who are the bad ones.Now all of this doesnt mean you cant make good money on bad projects some people made millions off them. But I think you need to be aware of what is going on here so you can plan your strategy accordingly. Next week I will go into more detail on the strategy I take on finding altcoins and managing risk.**3 DONT JOIN A CULT**Perhaps one of the most dangerous aspects in crypto is the cult. It starts out innocently enough. A friend or someone you respect shills you a crypto project. You decide to read up on it via their website and whitepaper. You begin to follow the project on Twitter and join the Discord & Telegram groups. But this is where the problems start. Because the deeper you go into a project & the more involved you feel the more dangerous it becomes. You are led to believe you are in a ‘community & that you are all ‘gonna make it when in fact you are joining a cult.Cults are incredibly dangerous in crypto because they remove your objectivity & critical thinking on a project. Youre surrounded by people in Telegram groups & Discords who all hold the same biased belief system. And these belief systems & subsequent emotions are amplified ten fold because money is involved. Think about it no one is going to doubt their own project when they have so much money invested.You see cult members everywhere. They are your friends in whatsapp groups desperately trying to shill you a coin they aped into. They are those random people on Twitter trying to constantly push a project onto you. Everyday I get so many requests to buy project ‘x or ‘x to the moon but i will never listen. I will always form my own strategy (which will change with time & research) and evaluate accordingly. Some of you may not like my bluntness but I am not here to tell you what you want to hear or sugar coat it. I want to help you & tell you the truth.In short its essential you do four things* Form your own strategy based on research (and always be willing to change it).* Dont become a cult member always be objective.* Dont fall for random shills everyone is talking about.* Dont listen to people who only believe in one project & refuse to change their hypothesis.**4 DONT HODL**HODL right? Thats what we are told to do. Just HOLD and we are all going to make it. Nope. Outside of Bitcoin and maybe Etherum you cannot blindly HODL a project. There is no guarantee it is going to make it or that it will be around in the next five years. The altcoin space is incredibly volatile which is great for exponential gains but can also get you wrecked if you blindly hold onto your bags.You need to stop falling in love with a project. Oh ‘but the tech is so good or ‘the founder is a genius I hear you cry. I really dont care. You need to stop holding your bags for years and take profits when you can. Taking profits is not only essential to de-risk yourself it is also a great way to release capital to invest in other projects. I recently wrote a thread on taking profits which seemed to be popular which you can read below.**5 STACK BLUE CHIPS**As I have said earlier most altcoins wont make it. Even if they run up x5 or x10 this bull run there is still a chance they could run to zero in the next bear market. Whether you like it or not your primary objective should be to use the altcoins to increase your gains take profits and layer into ‘less volatile projects like Bitcoin. For all the talk of ‘Bitcoin is a boomer coin the fact is it is the project that has been around the longest and the one which almost certainly wont fail. And lets be honest if someone offered you fifty Bitcoin would you really say no?Again many of you wont like this point of view but again i am not here to sugar coat things. The crypto game is tough and I want to help you by telling you the truth.**CONCLUSION**If you made it this far I salute you. Many will have got angry at the truths I laid out. Others may have become disillusioned that the whole game is rigged and there is no hope of winning. But this is not the case at all. As I mentioned at the beginning of this article you first need to know the rules of the game if you want a chance to win it. This first article is essential because it sets the ground rules of what to avoid & what to do; be weary of big influencers dont join a cult dont HODL alts & always stack blue chips (Bitcoin).Now we have these rules in place and truths exposed we can begin to build our own strategy and figure out how to play this game better.Thank you for reading!original source[https//www.getrevue.co/profile/brandsandblockchain/issues/the-secret-rules-of-crypto-1008223](https//www.getrevue.co/profile/brandsandblockchain/issues/the-secret-rules-of-crypto-1008223),904,0.83,683,2022-01-18 22:21:33
Who else is ignoring the FUD and feeling really bullish on crypto for 2022?,Title covers it in a sentence Ive been in crypto for a few years and Im hearing the same tired excuses this January that are repeated every time the market dips/corrects/crashes.This time its overThe experts are saying that the stock markets are going to crash any day nowBTC was funded by printed money is the only reason it pumped it will never pump againBlah blah blah. Every time these lines of reason are rolled out and every time crypto pumps back up again. You wouldnt get this in the regular stock market people dont see a recession and be all like well thats it for stocks its been all pump for 100 years but its over forever now&#x200B;Well Ive read it all before and I dont see anything to worry me. The markets already down almost 50% from ATH and has been stable for 9 days and counting meaning huge gains when we set a new ATH and despite the painting the FUD wants to share I see that ATH hitting in this year with no issue.,883,0.91,506,2022-01-15 13:56:51
CCIP-025 - Algorithmic MOONs Pricing for Reddit Special Membership, ——————————————————————————**Problem**Current Special Membership (Paid in MOONs) is not being used due to the simple fact that price is 1000 MOONs or 5$ no one will choose to pay 1000 Moons - equivalent to paying ~118$!.——————————————————————————**Solution**Realistic Special Membership Cost First step is changing the price to 100 MOONs.Admins are now allowing updates to membership pricing but do not yet support dynamic pricing. Once Moons can support this or mods are able to change the price monthly we will use the followingSubscription price will be algorithmically updated each month after snapshot day and calculated like this..**P * 100 / (1/R) = Membership Price in MOONs.***Where P is subscription price in USD.* Membership Price in Fiat is 5$*R = MOON/Karma Ratio  R bigger than 0*After simple operations this can be reduced it to **500 * R** which is much more convenient for users to calculate...For example previous month ratio was [0.233](https//www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rrinwg/new_moons_are_ready_round_21/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)**Final Formula 500R****500 * 0.233 = 116.5 MOONs**..This month ratio is [0.277](https//www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/s81naj/new_moons_distribution_round_22_proposal/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) **500 * 0.233 = 138.5 MOONs**..——————————————————————————You may think that keeping 1000 MOONs per membership is better because these MOONs gets burned.These MOONs are not really getting burned instead they get reintroduced in later rounds. This is artificial and temporary scarcity why burning 1000 and not 10000 MOONs? 1000 points was the initial default price that is supposed to be changed after a year and a half there is still no change and its time to do so.On top of that 1000 MOONs are getting burned from the Community Tank - wallet that is not affecting the market anyway. If users start to actually buy special membership using MOONs these MOONs get burned from users - something that have impact on the market.——————————————————————————[For Consideration in The Future](https//www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencyMeta/comments/s6c6cj/advanced_solution_algorithmic_moons_pricing_for/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)[View Poll](https//www.reddit.com/poll/s8dq31),887,0.96,328,2022-01-20 07:54:57

New threat America COMPETES Act,If it passes in its origin form it hands Janet yellen the power to unilaterally ban all forms of payments and remittances that provide any sort of anonymity. This obviously targets ALL cryptos and anyone who thinks otherwise is kidding themselves. US people need to write to their representatives IMMEDIATELY about this. The treasury may not choose to use it immediately or will argue it wont be for crypto but they will have to power to do so at anytime and that is something the space really really does not want hanging over it.Edit Source - https//www.coincenter.org/new-bill-would-hand-treasury-blank-check-to-ban-crypto-at-exchanges/,867,0.96,148,2022-01-26 21:57:06

I see it now. Most of us are neither investors nor traders. We are a bunch of gamblers!,I had a post last day advising people to be either a trader or an investor and god did it get some crazy reactions!Half of you said we are both. Another half were pissed (dont tell us what to do!). Out of five hundred comments and more  only a handful understood what I was actually saying.Let me elaborateA trader is someone who is trading on daily basis. A trader does not give a damn if it is bear market or bull market. And only like two people said it in comments. When you say  I am part trader and part investor I invest in ETH and buy shitcoins for quick bucks  you mean that you want something that go up a considerable amount to then sell it. Let me break it up to you. It is called short term investment! A trader can trade BTC or ETH or any other asset with enough price volatility.A treader will not go around saying I bought this much Shib but it is now down 30% so I will hold till it go back.He will sell the moment he understands that market movement is downward. Ofc a trader might have a wallet with some BTC for long term investment in it but he/she is still a trader. I can confidently say that less than 1% of people in this sub are traders. You know why? Because traders are extremely busy trading. And they know shit. I am not a trader but some of my friends are  and they dont have time for their childrens birthday party.  My point wasnt it is impossible to do both.Rather it is impossible to be both.Why? Because you need to have two separate mindsets. And in the end one mindset is much more dominant. And we are not skilled enough to be both. At least most of us are not. As some of you put it correctly many of us have a third mentality which didnt came to my mind while writing that post. Most of us are neither a trader bor an investor but rather a gambler. Why? Because as I told you before traders dont give a fuck about markets general trend. And investors are usually extremely calculative and patient.Then it hit me. You were right! We are gamblers.It explains everything!That is why we try to quit when we lose money but we always come back.That is why we have like hundred posts here everyday calling the whole cryptomarket a big scam and this is why the same people will go on buying Elonsperm anyway.That is why everyone here is pissed when market is red and in a good mood when it is green.Isnt these acts remind you of something?Like a gambler who had a bad day at casino?It seems we are far far away from choosing between being a trader or an investor.For now it is a great step forward if we quit gamblers mindset.Respect to you allVve,861,0.78,682,2022-02-01 00:39:16

MOONS are definetly a s*itcoin. No utility no liquidy or even a roadmap.,This sub is very anti-shitcoin and sure why shouldnt it be people are thinking some just made shitcoins are a better investment than some utility crypto. Over the longterm the utility always wins and hype leaves.But thus subs own crypto MOONS are also definitely a shitcoin. Its far away from any utility let liquidity be it is not even listed on ANY good-enough exchanges let alone the major ones. There is no easy or understandable way from selling those apart from a 45 step swap.And there is no real roadmap for the near future with specific dates. The only thing we know is that a mainnet is coming. Someday.I definitely do not say MOONS will forever be shit but they for now are and there is no point against that and in also sure people are currently working to change that and I appreciate those people.Just dont push MOONS as some breakout crypto for now...*liquidity,864,0.88,588,2022-02-02 21:36:13
Can we all agree that Facebook definitely overhyped the term metaverse?,Connecting with anyone  anywhere on a completely virtual world sounds like a dream but the reality is far from that. All these metaverse games Sandbox (yes I know its in alpha but still) and Decentraland feel like cheap Roblox clones except that you can buy some virtual land for real housing money?Thats not what we got promised. I know that these projects are not associated with Facebook but then can you consider them a virtual world? If Roblox introduced a real estate mechanic would it make Roblox a metaverse? Probably not.So the debate is what exactly is the metaverse ? Collection of crypto roblox games or an actual virtual world?,862,0.93,468,2022-01-11 19:05:39
If you dont have an enormous sum of money in crypto you dont have to worry about most of the posts you see here.,All of the detailed minutia of crypto is fascinating. Using native wallets staking airdrops cold storage etc is all great. But if you are trading in the hundreds or even in the thousands....you really dont need to worry about all that.Between gas fees human error scams and hackers you will likely be better off just trading on an exchange and there is nothing wrong with that.This community tends to hate on exchanges (not your keys not your coins) but they do have legitimate use for the large majority of retail users who are just trying to throw a bit of extra cash into some investments. You dont need to panic if you have $500 of BTC on an exchange because you dont own the keysAs long as you are using reputable companies like Coinbase and CDC (not you Binance) you are not likely to have any issues.,856,0.89,551,2022-01-18 15:14:18
I would rather lose all my money than miss the rocket to 100k,The fear is real these days with many people calling that the bull market is over. Nobody knows that is going to happen but personally I dont think so and in any case I am not selling at all. If anything I am buying more as I have not invested more than I can afford to lose so I dont care what happens.Of course nobody wants to lose money but you have to decide. Imagine you sell now and later this year we break 100k. I would rather lose all my money than not being invested once this happens. The risk of NOT holding is just too high in my opinion.Crypto is the only chance to achieve financial freedom and escape the hamster wheel we are all stuck in. I am gladly taking the risk for this possibility. If the money is gone nothing changes anyway and we keep hamster wheeling.&#x200B;*Not financial advice as usual only my personal opinion.*,855,0.86,391,2022-01-12 11:40:57

Seeing so many anti-crypto people not having any idea of what crypto actually is thats the most bullish thing.,Just looking over a few Subreddits here like r/technology or even better twitter you can very fastly see the mutual hatred for Crypto there. Posts about crypto usually get bombed with the most classic argument after its all a scam crypto is killing the environment due to mining.I mean its right to some extent that crypto is using electricity that is unsustainable for mining. With that dancing the environment. But those people are onto some other stuff. Many thinking that all 5k cryptos use mining that is 100% unsustainable.So lets be clear very few cryptos nowadays use pow and even then the energy for mining is getting more and more sustainable. At least already more than their beloved banks.Seeing so many people uneducated about crypto but spreading hate shows how much growing room we still have left.,853,0.88,649,2022-02-06 21:22:14
Its time to end tribalism now.,I dont care if you are a Solana fan ETH moonboi Bitcoin or bust etcThe time to end tribalism is now. The church of Charles Hoskinson (yes that guy many of you love to hate) just blessed us with a video and I really think you need to watch it.https//youtu.be/a2IP9ApZuUUBasically the government is about to pass this America Competes bill under the guise of staying competitive against China. Its a load of crap. The bill sneaks in a part where the secretary of Treasury (Janet Yellen) will have full control to just ban assets at will.That means she can ban ALL of crypto or just certain ones in particular. She can wake up and say hey no more ETH trading in America. Exchanges will have to comply. This is serious.I normally dont post because Im not good with all the formatting and pretty pictures but this is so fucking serious guys. Stop with the stupid tribalism stop acting like children. Now is the time to come together and reach out to the people who live off our tax dollars that are supposed to serve us. When you follow the money guess whos lobbying so hard for this to pass? Ding ding ding  the Goldman Sachs Mafia. Banks are finally trying to put the nail in the coffin for crypto. TLDR stop bickering for one moment and pay attention to this BS legislation thats about to change crypto. Also fuck off and read my shit its like 10 sentences.,843,0.88,404,2022-01-26 16:59:07
Bullish news from the Fed rates remain unchanged no uncertainty or change in strategy.,edit Things have turned a little sour in the meeting.The follow up press conference didnt sound that bullish. While the minutes indicated that there is no increased rates from whats already planned JPow had some hawkish undertones in his answers. Nothing sounded too dovish.And he is even now saying there could be increases.We are back to neutral...maybe even bearish.But there is a lot of fog in JPows answers. And he said a lot of the decisions will come in the next meeting in March with more details on numbers.Stock crash potentially back on the table. ____________________&#x200B;~~As you might have already guessed with stocks shooting up and cryptos spking we didnt get the doom and gloom news today we got some moderately bullish news.~~~~Keep in mind inflation is still very high so its not all rosy either.~~~~So long term there are still major economic issues looming.~~~~Its also not super bullish for liquidity or artificially propping up stocks with lowered rates.~~~~But its a fine balance and probably a best case scenario.~~&#x200B;~~In the minutes they mention unemployment has dropped and the economic outlook is improving according to the Fed.~~~~So maybe no stock market crash...for this week.~~~~Meaning maybe no Bitcoin crash below $30K this week either.~~~~In fact the spike in Bitcoin could potentially create a short squeeze and we could see prices above $40K this week.~~&#x200B;~~But we are not quiet out of the woods yet~~~~We still have the press meeting....so dont pull out the party hats yet.~~~~We still need to hear how dovish or hawkish JPow might sound and we havent heard about timelines.~~,839,0.9,582,2022-01-26 19:11:11

Be realistic its not over,I can not believe that one and a half green days has got some of you talking about the dip in past tense. That some how this isnt over and we are heading back to 69k tomorrow especially since all the macro economic issues that are causing this havent been resolved at all Let us not forget the inflation bubble that will pop eventually like 2008.This is not fud. We holders will make excellent money if we seize the opportunity of this bubble pop. Shilling lethal doses of hopium is good but not realistic ❤Be realistic this IS NOT OVER YET.Edit all Im saying is to keep your wits about you and dont make foolish choices. When In doubt DCA.

The global crypto market ($1.73T) is still worth less than a single US company (Apple $2.64T). If you think the largest decentralized financial system will never recover then sell and move on.,Just wanted to put some perspective/hopium with this recent drop and that we are nowhere close to golds market cap (10 trillion) and stock market (50 trillion). If BTC hit 100k it would only closely match apple and still be nowhere close to golds market cap. I still have money invested in the stock market because I believe in the future of US companies but even I think its overvalued compared to what crypto could bring to financial networks.And yes apple is a big company that is also internal national but I still think the idea of crypto and the technology being developed by over 10000+ developers  deserves a much higher valuation. The negatives about crypto are what is highlighted like the exploitation of NFTs scams and pump and dumps.  Take a look at the bigger picture and you can see that nothing has changed.,827,0.9,305,2022-01-25 01:08:13

Dont be in denial. This is what bear market looks like. Dont expect BTC to bounce back to 69k in no time.,Im seeing a lot of posts here and on Twitter people promoting buy the dip or hold tight itll bounce back. Truth is no one knows how far down market will go and if or when it will bounce back. Interest rates are tipped to rise we are on brink of a war Omicron is out of control and the bad news keep piling up. Point is dont take anyones advice because in crypto world no one has any idea what will happen next. Keep your money safe and dont make decisions thatll make you miserable. I have invested at wrong times many times now and I know the feeling. Its awful. So assess your personal situation and expect for things to get worse.,817,0.87,401,2022-01-22 08:03:00
Fuck government The experience about living in a country where cryptocurrency is Illegal,***Corruption is legal and Cryptocurrency is Illegal***&#x200B;Not a great writer&#x200B;So yeah this does exist and you can go to jail for trading/holding cryptocurrency. You maybe wondering which country it is. Its located in South East Asia called Nepal. Ive been into crypto space for almost a two year now and its like living in the future. Recently Three people got arrested and four member of the same family got arrested for trading cryptocurrency. Kudos to those who got arrested. May satoshi be with you. Fuck this country man so tired of this fucking government fuck the system. Im so frustated and deperessed reading these types of news warning about cryptocurrency. The government doesnot give a fuck about development its all corrupted from the root. I want to keep a low profile now but fuck man talk about freedom nothing like this actually exist we are just bind by the shitty rules made by government. kudos to those who live in a country where you can hold and trade cryptos freely and can experience financial freedom. I have huge respect for those country. I want to get out of this shithole country and do what I want freely. So yeah good bye to the r/CC community but Ill be back when they make crypto Legal or meet a point where I dont give a fuck and keep trading and holding crypto.&#x200B;https//preview.redd.it/5avwrsbuz7e81.png?width=847&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b7fa19d4a25a48121756c92499a094425f35e02https//preview.redd.it/ihxg5vbuz7e81.png?width=736&format=png&auto=webp&s=302b853ad5746fa4fd30f68dbdd5a3435c79ba89,812,0.92,402,2022-01-27 12:00:52

This is not even close to a bear market yet and you shouldnt lose hope in the market.,For a bear market to happen it would take a lot more than just -42% over a period of 2 months. Weve seen as much as -41% being wiped off the market in 2017 in a matter of weeks yet the bull run kept continuing for months. It is not unrealistic to expect the same thing could happen now in 2022.# Comparing the May correction to the current onehttps//preview.redd.it/5ks3gv1qtsc81.jpg?width=1247&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0fbf56939bbe923c429c47518b6f608fe18a7ebbBitcoin has also hit a pretty significant support level and is refusing to go below it. This is the same support level that Bitcoin held in late September before hitting a new all-time high.The bearish price action were seeing is still nothing compared to what happened from May - July.  In June/July almost everyone was calling for a bear market but Bitcoin still recovered within a few months. # Hash rate shows market is undervalued rather than overvaluedhttps//preview.redd.it/q3oxrse2ysc81.png?width=1273&format=png&auto=webp&s=f764e0eea23cb0b849bbe263a3456f9ec3d57033Moreover a bear market usually comes when the entire market is overvalued which seems far from the truth considering Bitcoin hit a new hash rate high. If Bitcoin was overvalued hash rates reaching new highs would be completely irrational as Bitcoin is not cheap to mine. **TLDR** There is still hope in the market because theres still a high likelihood of the market bouncing back like it did in July and September. A -42% loss over a 2 month period is more of a correction than a bear market and the metrics also show only one thing and that is we are still far from a bear market.,787,0.8,615,2022-01-20 08:30:54

Selling the Rally is just as important as Buying the Dip.,We would all be millionaires if we had a dollar each time someone told us to HODL forever. I wont be surprised if some people didnt take profits just for the fear of having Paper hands.I cant vouch for other communities cause I just lurk around in this sub and you will agree with me when I say that this community scorns those who even *think* of taking profits.Now I can bet that a lot of people here regret not listening to their **own intelligence** and taking some sweet profits before the big red hit us all this year. We chant Buy the dip everyday in this sub hell even in the entire crypto world but never have I heard someone say Sell the rally.So here I am giving you all a heads up for the inevitable crypto rally this year**It is OKAY to take some PROFITS !****It is OKAY to be able to sleep at night with no regrets.****It is OKAY to miss some extra green because you didnt want to risk it.**Honestly everyone who has been there in the crypto market books profit every now and then they just keep it a secret. And all the newbies fall for the trap called HODL till death. Just dont do that. Hodl isnt some holy grail you need to abide by all the time.DCA and HODL is definitely a very smart strategy to invest in good projects but dont forget to get your family something nice with crypto profits. In case you fear missing out on huge pumps best hodl *some* while booking profits on a *small* percentage of your bag. This is a win-win situation where you minimize both risk and regrets while still HODLing.Lastly If you have extra money Buy the Dip fellas!,769,0.87,490,2022-01-21 13:07:49

Loopring - A Deep Dive,Hey guys Im Spragg I do deep dives into various different coins/tokens on youtube (SpraggTalksMoney) I thought since Ive already written the scripts for my video anyway Id post the summary on here too.If anyones interested in the full un-summarized version the link is here [https//youtu.be/j5cEdmAeICU](https//youtu.be/j5cEdmAeICU)## PrefaceIn the top 40 tokens ranked by market cap only 6 arent on Ethereum with those being on the Binance smart chain but this makes sense if you were opening a shop in real life youd want to do it where the people are and not in the middle of the countryside. Ethereum while long maintaining its position as the largest smart contract chain does have its problems those being gas fees and congestion.This means that while anything built on Ethereum gets the benefits of decentralisation and security it inherits those problems too.DEXs are in my opinion though are some of the most important aspects to the free trade of crypto allowing for swapping between any on chain or wrapped asset but if you wanted to perform a trade on uniswap now youd be paying well over $150 in fees.And this is where loopring comes in aiming to not only solve these existing problems and provide a completely new take on how DEXs should function.## FoundationLike a lot of the current markets most promising protocols Loopring created by Daniel Wang an ex google software engineer first appeared in the form of an ICO in the 2017 bull run raising 45 million. Unfortunately Daniel and his team are based in Shanghai and as we all know China loves to flip flop on their crypto regulation coming out with new laws outlawing ICOs forcing the Loopring Foundation to refund most of the funds earnt. However from the ICO there was 20k Ethereum not refunded which at the time was worth around 7.5 million and with this they forged on with the creation of the Loopring protocol.Unlike a lot of projects in the crypto space that start their marketing extremely early to try and hook investors sometimes before the product even has a working first version Loopings focus was on creating the product and then letting it sell itself. Arguably had the market not become so crowded with people almost acting like salesmen trying to shove any half-baked crypto project down peoples throats this strategy probably wouldve worked.This isnt to say that the company isnt starting to move towards providing a greater feature set such as Ethereum virtual machine compatibility but given how tight lipped theyve been on the topic shows that they dont want this to dominate the narrative of what the platform actually currently does.## Loopring ProtocolLoopring aims to give anyone the tools to build their own DEX but without needing to go through any of the problems in actually starting a DEX Loopring is to decentralised exchanges what the Tendermint SDK is to Proof of stake. Its certainly not the only way to do it but it cuts out a large portion of the groundwork required.At the core of Loopring is a Zero Knowledge Proof rollup layer built on top of the Ethereum base chain since not many people know what this actually is or entails I thought Id briefly explain it.The Zero Knowledge proof is not unique to crypto it in fact pre-dates it by over 25 years and is a cryptographic protocol that allows a party to prove that a statement is true to a recipient party what makes it significant though is that the recipient party doesnt need to be privy to any potentially secret information that goes into proving the statement.Think of it like a magic trick if a magician said he could predict the suit and number of a card we will draw from a deck of cards and then proceeds to do it and get it right we can assume that it wasnt just sheer luck and that he can in fact do what he says he can but we as the second party have no idea how the trick was done.So when we apply this to crypto we get the ability to prove to the base chain that something happening on a side chain or layer 2 is verifiably true which as we all know is extremely important in a trustless environment like a blockchain.So now we move onto the rollup part on the base chain in this case Ethereum a transaction is a single monetary transfer from a to b this means that to process 100 transfers you need 100 transactions.A much more efficient way of doing this would be to process 100 transfers and put them all through at once under a single transaction. The problem with doing this however is the blockchain can only verify the transaction and not data within the event log of the transaction and so in this case it would assume the 100 transactions are all invalid and reject them unless it could be proven otherwise.So to combine this all together a zkRollup works by performing transactions off chain and then submitting them back to the main chain as a single transaction with the proof required to confirm that what happened off chain still conforms to the base chains rules and that theyre all valid transactions so that the base chain can process them accordingly as though it had done the work itself.This technology is what Loopring uses along with Relayers to allow anyone to create a DEX and keep gas fees low.At the core of everything is the loopring relayer. The relayer is in charge of virtually everything in the ecosystem from generating the proofs building blocks matching orderbooks and more.The loopring protocol will work with any relayer however there is currently a single canonical relayer being used which is run by the Loopring foundation now I do have some concerns about this which I will as usual cover at the end but all you need to know is that the Loopring protocol is entirely non-custodial.## Token Supply and DistributionTheres currently 1.2 billion LRC in circulation which is 100 million less than the max supply of 1.3 billion which is due to the fact that a portion of the supply has been burnt.Any operation the loopring protocol will incur a fee same as performing any action on the blockchain in the case of Loopring this is just 0.3% of the transaction value where 0.2% is returned to the liquidity providers as incentive and 0.1% goes to the loopring DAO.The use of the LRC value held by the Loopring DAO is voted on with the options for its use being grants to incentivize partnerships impermanent loss protection liquidity incentives on top of the 0.2% fee and then finally burning LRC.# ConcernsFirstly despite the protocol being Relayer agnostic that is to say that anyone can build a relayer and start to perform network actions the only current Relayer operated by the Loopring foundation. This unfortunately does mean that theres a centralised aspect to the network as it currently stands.Now hopefully Ive done a good enough job of explaining why this isnt an immediate red flag for the platform given that the entire point is to be non-custodial and have layers on layers of protocol specifics to ensure that control is always entirely in the users hands I just personally dont like the fact that the security of an investment into LRC would depend on the Loopring foundation upkeeping that relayer.And my second concern is to do with marketting.As it stands currently loopring has $450m locked within the contract which for a project sitting at 2.1 billion market cap is lower than I wouldve expected. Take Curve for example which is sitting only 100 million dollars higher in market cap but has over 20 billion dollars locked by its contract on Ethereum alone.This on its own might not be cause for concern but the DEX created by the Loopring foundation was born out of being unable to secure partners to build their own DEXs and show off the platform. This to me shows that for the platform to survive more of an emphasis needs to be placed on getting the protocol out into the wider DeFi audience and not just within the retail space where it currently seems to be sitting.,756,0.89,270,2022-01-14 19:02:20
People talk about CRO *so* much I was shocked to find it at .43 cents. With the explosion of Crypto.com is there any reason CRO wouldnt keep growing for the long run?,Crypto.com reminds me of the Amazon Facebook or Google of the Crypto world. They are spending billions on advertising they are clearly in it for the long haul they have great name recognition. I have no doubt they will throw their entire bankroll behind big names to lead their different departments. They will buy up smaller start up technology and continue to put huge amounts of money into anything they do. They seem incredibly proactive and on top of things. Having said that is there any reason that Crypto.com would thrive but the CRO coin would fail?

Watched  The big short yesterday and was shocked of what actually went down. I fully understand why cryptocurrency was created because the system messed up big time.,If youve never seen the movie I definitely recommend it! This text might contain some spoilers.Ive always heard of the movie the big short but never watched it before. I was shocked at what went down and how totally ignorant people banks hedge funds etc were to giving loans or investing in loans without having any liquidity behind it. For me the most mind blowing fact is that only 1 guy went to jail **1 GUY!**. Like always the average Joe ended up paying for all the shit that banks started being so greedy. Although cryptocurrency is far from perfect its a very different approach being (mostly) decentralised and trying to even the playing field for both the rich and the poor. Have you seen the movie? What do you think of the events that happened? Curious!,742,0.88,738,2022-01-15 10:29:03
A bear market is a real financial term,Some of you here are so delusional. At least daily I see someone saying some variation of it hasnt dipped below -irrelevant support- so its not a bear market! No. A bear market is an ACTUAL financial term with an actual definition. >a bear market has a very specific definition when the market is down 20% *for at least a two-month period*It does NOT matter if it hasnt dipped below the previous bottom etc. Youve all been deceived into thinking bear markets are bad. Theyre not. Theyre where accumulation happens. You cant properly DCA without dips.Edit and for all of you saying Crypto is different!!! would you have the same attitude if we were coming out of the bull market that got us to ~$1k? Why not?

Whenever the cryptocurrencies I held rose sharply I would immediately sell and buy it so (I thought) that it will rise even higher the next time it rises. Today I learned that was a fucking stupid mistake of mine and totally stupid.,I died of embarrassment today. Following conversation on DiscordMe Ive been holding Ethereum since last January and Im currently up 250% but thats also because Ive sold it and bought it again many times when it was rising strongly.My friend Huh? Why is that?Me (honorary math professor) Because I get more profit.*Silence*Me The following Imagine investing 100€ in Ethereum. The price goes up by 20%. Now I have 120€. If I now sell and buy again - and disregard the transaction fees - and the price rises again by 20% I am at 144€. If I had not sold it would have risen by 40% and I would only have 140€. Understand?*LOUD SILENCE IN THE DISCORD CHAT*Friend 1 Is it just me who thinks this is incredibly stupid?Friend 234 No Nope Nah that makes absolutely no sense I (slowly despairing🥲) think to myself that I could have saved the transaction fees which are astronomical with Coinbase anyway for one thing and that from now on the story will be held in front of me again and again if I dont manage to clarify it now. So I try to explain the thing again and already during this I realize that it sounds really dumb.My friends laugh at me and I cry (mentally).Edit That math professor thing is a joke,737,0.88,540,2022-01-11 23:33:59
CCIP-026 - Increase the time to hide comment scores from 5 to 60 minutes,There is a subreddit setting called Minutes to hide comment scores which does exactly what it says.  The idea behind this setting is to hide comment scores to reduce [the bandwagon effect](https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwagon_effect).  That is to say visible comment scores introduce cognitive bias* Most people are more likely to think a comment is good or bad based on how others have already voted* There is also the reverse bandwagon effect where people will intentionally do the opposite of what the popular opinion is* Sometimes users will think a comments score is too high or low and use their vote to correct it.  For example thinking a comment with 200 upvotes is good but not great so they downvote it even though they thought it was goodThis kind of bias negatively influences they quality of votes because it considers how everyone else voted instead of just the quality of the comment itself.  Currently this setting is set to 5 minutes but Im proposing that it be increased to 60 minutes.Some additional technical notes* **Comment sorting is unaffected** even though the specific scores are not visible* **Your own comment scores are still visible to you** this only affects seeing scores on comments by other users* Comment scores are still visible to mods so work against vote manipulation is unaffected* The time to hide scores can always be adjusted again in the futureCCMeta post https//www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencyMeta/comments/s45e8f/preproposal_the_time_to_hide_comment_scores/[View Poll](https//www.reddit.com/poll/s88hbt),728,0.97,226,2022-01-20 03:06:51

BTC isnt anonymous if something finds your address your whole history f3ckd,Theres more to decentralization than using BTCI see these people all the time and Im sure you do as well. People who think that once theyve moved on to using BTC theyre forever freed of taxes institutions the government and ‘big brother. Well it doesnt work that way and those a little more experienced in crypto will tend to agree.Bitcoin was an experiment it went well but it still has a long way to go. Bitcoin isnt anonymous its pseudonymous anyone who can find one address of yours can track your entire search history. Something else Bitcoin has to work on is the largeholder control. A few whales control the majority of the market. Decentralized organizations have already solved this using DAOs. You see when you use a DAO take BitDAO for example you dont have to put your trust in the hands of a few sketchy men. Instead you are given the choice of handing your confidence to the entirety of the public. No honest man is in power and no power is given to an honest man. You cant trust humans to control your fortunes. You too should handle a share of the responsibility of the fortunes of yours as well as others and thats how DAOs work. If you only trust politicians to rule and soldiers to fight then dont be surprised when war is fought by fools and governments are ruled by cowards.,727,0.78,1063,2022-01-16 17:03:56
Crypto is teaching a lot of young people how to invest and manage their money.,A lot of people discovered the world of personal finance through Crypto. This may be a big generational change. In the US a lot of people were already invested in the stock market and in their 401K. But in a lot of European countries people are not invested in the world of Finance (for example in France the retirement is nationalized so people have less incentive to make their own portfolios)&#x200B;One of the underestimated aspect of crypto is the education provided to people about financial products markets and many other aspects of money management.

Ive lived and breathed Defi for over a year now here are my best low-risk Defi strategies for each major chain,Defi *decentralized finance* is often referred to as the *Wild Wild West of Crypto*. But after journeying in Defi for over a year Ive learned that the West is only wild for the cowboys and mercenaries—they are known as degens around these parts. For this post Ill provide ways for you to prosper in the Wild West as a steady and humble farmer.Edit Forgot to mention that this guide prioritizes security over profits. The rules of the low-risk strategies are to (1) hold *pristine assets* like BTC and ETH (2) avoid impermanent loss and splitting assets as you would by directly being in a LP position (3) use reputable dapps (4) use simple strategies (no leverage no auto-compounding etc.). # Ethereum - Very high gas feesWallet - [Metamask](https//metamask.io/) or [Ledger](https//www.ledger.com/ledger-live)   |   Dex - [Uniswap](https//defillama.com/protocol/uniswap) or [SushiSwap](https//defillama.com/protocol/sushiswap) are both goodI wouldnt recommend Defi on Ethereum due to high fees and because the roadmap is to ~~stop using Ethereum for general purposes~~ migrate to layer 2s; but there are protocols that are only the Ethereum network right now. When using Ethereum I recommend using as few dapps as possible to avoid gas fees.**The simplest Ethereum Defi strategy is to deposit ETH into Tokemak.** The expected yield is 8-12%. Using [Tokemak](https//defillama.com/protocol/tokemak) youll be a single-token liquidity provider. This allows you to avoid impermanent loss (IL) and you can hold 100% of ETH instead of splitting your assets like a typical liquidity provider.But the IL doesnt just disappear. There are other type of users that work as managers who play a role in deciding how the protocols makes profits. I wont dive deeper into this aspect since its a different strategy but for those interested to learn more heres an [explanation](https//www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMZ_fS1uZaU).Downsides Expect to spend heavily on fees (~$200) on bridging to Ethereum as well as approving and depositing ETH. And the same amount for the withdrawing process. If the fees are peanuts to you feel free to use this strategy Mr/Mrs. Whale. Youll be earning rewards via the protocol token TOKE as rewards which may not be ideal given that TOKE does suffer from high price volatility and selling pressure.# Polygon - Negligible fees (~$0.02)Wallet - [Metamask](https//metamask.io/) or [Ledger](https//www.ledger.com/ledger-live)   |   Dex - [QuickSwap](https//defillama.com/protocol/quickswap) [Uniswap](https//defillama.com/protocol/uniswap) or [SushiSwap](https//defillama.com/protocol/sushiswap)Polygon really made its strides between April to July 2021 when they launched a $40M [incentive program](https//cryptobriefing.com/polygon-launches-40m-liquidity-mining-program-with-aave/) and since theyve been reliable and competitive. And with Polygon fees being so low youre pretty much free to do whatever.**In terms of low-risk Defi investing an Aave + Curve strategy is currently the golden standard.** Adding the rates for lending and providing liquidity and subtracting it from the costs of borrowing the expected yield is 4-6%. This can be done by depositing into [Aave](https//defillama.com/protocol/aave) using the deposits as collateral to borrow a stablecoin and using the borrowed stablecoins to provide liquidity in Curve.As a low-risk user the ideal borrowing rate is 30% of your deposits (ie. deposit $1K borrow $300). At this rate youll be liquidated if your deposits depreciate more than 45%. Given that it historically takes several days or cryptos like BTC or ETH to crash giving you a long enough timeframe to manage your risks. You can further mitigate liquidation risks are to deposit stablecoins which improves the stability of your portfolio while depositing even more volatile assets like MATIC will increase risks. Its all about risk management.Downsides Borrowing and lending on Aave exposes you to liquidation risk and will require you to properly manage your assets. You will be your own bank and that isnt easy. Alas this is one of the few ways to participate while holding assets like BTC and ETH and avoiding liquidity providing risks. Youll be earning rewards in wrapped MATIC and some rewards in CRV (a protocol token but has good fundamentals and has held its value historically).# Terra - Relatively high fees (~$1)Wallet - [Terrastation](https//station.terra.money/)   |   Dex - [TerraSwap](https//defillama.com/protocol/terraswap) or [AstroPort](https//defillama.com/protocol/astroport)Terra is flag-shipped by the successes of Anchor Protocol and their stablecoin ecosystem that has a presence among most major defi networks thanks to the Cosmos network. But the option in Terra network itself are limited. I would only recommend using Terra if you want exposure to LUNA or if youre in need of a Defi savings account. But I would consider exposure to LUNA as having medium to high risks which is beyond the scope of this post.**For low-risk Defi participation I can only recommend depositing UST in Anchors Saving Protocol.** The expected yield is 19% annual percentage yield. By using [Anchors](https//defillama.com/protocol/anchor) savings protocol youll be reward from the protocols revenue streams from (1) borrowing interest and (2) staking deposits. This revenue comes from another feature in Anchor that allows users to deposit LUNA or ETH and borrow UST the native algorithmic stablecoin.You can further optimize your yield via strategies like using your deposit as collateral for other protocols but again those are medium to high risk strategies that go beyond the scope.Downsides A ~19% savings account is an undoubtedly insane yield granted traditional banks can barely offer 1% for a similar product. But this isnt too far fetched given that Defi flips the model and instead of getting 20% of the revenue while banks get 80% Defi users get 100%. The risks are explained thoroughly [here](https//cryptorisks.substack.com/p/ust-december-2021). The ones that stand out are de-pegging regulatory risk and lowered yield as a result of [decreasing protocol revenue](https//cryptorisks.substack.com/p/on-abracadabra-degenbox-strategies).  Youll be earning rewards in UST.# Avalanche -  Low fees ($0.3) but can high (>$5) when congestedWallet - [Metamask](https//metamask.io/)   |   Dex - [TraderJoe](https//defillama.com/protocol/trader-joe) or [SushiSwap](https//defillama.com/protocol/sushiswap)A lot of big Defi players such as Aave Curve and Abracadabra also built on Avalanche which is why it was able to rapidly grow when it first launched. That and its $180M [incentive program](https//medium.com/avalancheavax/avalanche-foundation-announces-180m-defi-incentive-program-d320fdfafff7) which dwarfed Polygons incentive program.**With Avalanche you could do the same Aave + Curve strategy and get a similar yield.** But unlike Polygon ([at least not yet](https//forum.abracadabra.money/t/aip-3-deploy-abracadabra-money-on-polygon-pos/864)) Avalanche has Abracadabra which is a reputable dapp thats also built on Ethereum. So an **alternative low-risk strategy would be to use AAVE + Abracadabra.** The expected yield is 4-6%. Youll be borrowing and lending on [Aave](https//defillama.com/protocol/aave) and providing liquidity on [Curve](https//defillama.com/protocol/curve) or [Abracadabra](https//defillama.com/protocol/abracadabra).Under the hood youre using Curve to provide liquidity for stablecoins that includes its algorithmic stablecoin Magic Internet Money (MIM). The revenue comes from a liquidity fee that traders pay to swap between these stablecoins pairs. Again you dont need to know any more about the protocol but you can read more about it [here](https//medium.com/abracadabra-money/abracadabra-spell-and-magic-internet-money-a563637ce92e).Downsides Again youre borrowing and lending which makes you vulnerable to liquidation risks if youre mismanaging your assets. By using Abracadabra which works on top of Curve youre increasing your exposure to the smart contracts of three protocols. In Aave youll be earning rewards in wrapped AVAX and in Abracadabra in the protocol token SPELL (likewise to TOKE protocol tokens are not as ideal to hold as network tokens).&#x200B;---Ill end this post with these four networks that I believe present the best opportunities at a low-risk based on factors that include total value locked and history among others. This also isnt a list to rank Defi ecosystems I think each have their own benefits opportunities and risks. I know there are other promising networks out there with equally good if not better opportunities. Ill be making a follow-up posts on them. But for now thanks to anyone who read up to this point!,712,0.92,358,2022-01-16 05:59:24
The whales arent selling. Smaller investors are.,A lot of people left the Crypto market in fear of a Crypto winter. However the people who did not leave are the ones who went through at least 2 Bitcoin bull cycles and the whales. A 45% steady price decrease is nothing but an accumulation strategy and we can see this across the board with veteran wallets.# Largest Individual Bitcoin Wallet (Accumulating)https//preview.redd.it/2n5hczi7fhf81.png?width=1512&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f811ada619e43b9c547d3e4f4c77dbf74f548d4The largest individual wallet has also been accumulating Bitcoin in anticipation of a continued bull cycle. This wallet seemed to have been largely correct on calculating when to start accumulating. Moreover MicroStrategy and El Salvador are just two other examples out of hundreds of other corporations and whales that have started to accumulate cheap Bitcoin.# Bitcoin Supply on Exchanges at Multi-Year Low https//preview.redd.it/6cg71z74ihf81.png?width=1434&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f079f70bc3009f4271694b9551eca03c25a0534Despite the selling pressure from people that are panicking the exchanges are actually losing Bitcoin supply as most of it is being bought for cheap by whales. The Current supply has dropped to 13.27% and at this rate we could see huge supply shortages by 2028-2030 or even faster as the next Bitcoin halving will have a significant effect on supply.&#x200B;TLDR The only people who are currently selling are panicked investors or newbies whod rather take a 45% loss now than reduce that loss by DCAing. Whales are not selling and instead theyre buying up huge amounts of Bitcoin which has historically been a very bullish signal for the price.,713,0.9,396,2022-02-02 21:11:53
I analyse the 18 coins in Coinbase Venture portfolio from Jan 2021 to today date. $100 invested in each of these 18 coins is worth $22831 now. Also NASDAQ is +11% and Gold is -7%.,We all know Coinbase but not all of us had heard of Coinbase Venture. It is an investment arm of Coinbase to invest in early-stage cryptocurrency and blockchain startups. You can check the portfolio at Messari website.Their portfolio contains 18 coins as of  now* Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH)* Larger market cap ($5B plus) LUNA MATIC NEAR UNI* Average market cap ($1B plus) GRT FLOW AR CELO* Small market cap (less than $1B) AUDIO RLY UMA KEEP RSR DODO RARIOkay enough introduction. Lets see how these coins perform in the last 1 year from Jan 2021 to date.# 1. Overall performance - ROI 1168%; 15/18 up; 3/18 down[Coinbase Venture portfolio](https//preview.redd.it/axvjaey6c4g81.png?width=925&format=png&auto=webp&s=6508771f2076b077e3585e1bbb7ee17cec4cddc5)Even when the market is still down right now the return is 1168%. This is a great return compared to various asset classes.[Comparison to other asset classes](https//preview.redd.it/ujjxpreqc4g81.png?width=463&format=png&auto=webp&s=48e6e9b5fb65cd81cdd5efe5c04db7c1b7abe52a)Except oil which has a relatively fine return of 93% the rest isnt that impressive. And Mr Pete Im looking at you. Gold price actually decreased by 7% in the last year.# 2. The top gainers and which are the threes that make losses?The top 5 gainers in this portfolio is MATIC LUNA AR NEAR and AUDIO. The most impressive ones are MATIC and LUNA which had returned over 8000%.[Top gainers and 3 losers](https//preview.redd.it/brsh46l4d4g81.png?width=447&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e28276133d7844c27b79c70affee776b0088009)The losses are actually not that huge however. Its quite normal for small cap coins to lose over 90% value in a market downturn. Id say COMP will go back up pretty quickly once the market improves.# 3. Show me the sectors - which market niches do CV invested in and how do they performNow I sort the portfolio based on the sector. You could see BTC stands as a category even though its labelled as Currencies as it is the OG cryptocurrency but nowadays its more like a store value of money. BTC is also the staple in the many institutional investors holdings.[By sector](https//preview.redd.it/0foje1azd4g81.png?width=825&format=png&auto=webp&s=84ecbae33684c4167b940c6ff5cb13786ebe4f99)CV invested quite heavily in smart contract platforms which features ETH LUNA NEAR FLOW and CELO. Id also argue that MATIC is closely related though its not a L1 but with the high gas fees of Ethereum MATIC as the front runner of scalability will be needed for a foreseeable future. All of this category did well most notably LUNA and MATIC. NEAR also has a good run lately though its not often mentioned in this sub.Im quite surprised that CV didnt invest in ATOM and DOT the two front runners of interoperability. However they did invest in a small cap on this which is KEEP Network. So far it has doubled in value but probably needs more time to prove its worth.DeFi is a little disappointed at the moment but many has predicted DeFi will see its rise in 2022. CV invested in only 1 lending defi which is COMP.Other niche markets had been seeing mix results* Asset management (RSR) down at the moment but this is also quite new.* Content distribution AUDIO - which has returns quite nicely as its the front runner in music streaming.* Data management (The Graph) doing ok at the moment. It might have the time with Web3.* Exchanges (UNI and DODO) UNI has its time in 2021 like most others DODO has been in trouble with the hack last year.* File storage (AR) recently has partnered with Solana. AR is up over 1400% in the last year.* Tokenization (RLY and RARI) above average returns. Social tokens RLY and RARI is for buy/sell NFTs.**Hows your portfolio doing? Are you happy with your choice of coins? Are you planning to buy or sell anything new? Let me know in the comment.*****EDIT***I just do another deep dive into the list.

One focus I could find is that now they stress on the important of NFT utility phase - so think beyond a picture of a rock that is sold for $1.3M[Info from Coinbase blog](https//preview.redd.it/jwawkprtr5g81.png?width=833&format=png&auto=webp&s=afa00b8546378b047dfaddf2996313c646bd7195)For platform and developer tools the focus is now shifted to Web3 with the tool kits that help the developers to make things happen. Also they pay attention to API such as Alchemy.[Info from Coinbase blog](https//preview.redd.it/nhx2c898s5g81.png?width=880&format=png&auto=webp&s=34195984e01d7fb927dc502569da11d537575c56)For more info please visit the Coinbase Ventures website. They have a full list of investments. When I have time I can actually look further into which coins do they invested in.****EDIT 2****I could actually find another list of coins that Coinbase Venture had invested in. There are currently 38 coins (under **Coinbase Ventures Portfolio Screener**).

Some other interesting picks* Metaverse / Gaming - SAND - arguably one of the better games in the Metaverse now (stand out against a sea of garbage games)* Smart contracts - MINA CTK* Shared compute - LPT which is kind of similar to THETA focus on video infrastructure. It did have a pump in Nov 2021 (note not all alts have pumped crazily in Nov 2021)* Derivatives - SNX for Defi application. ,714,0.94,268,2022-02-06 02:19:00
Listen to what the youth are talking about and you will see the future.,Here for round 2 of why being a high school teacher has been an ear to the floor revelation for me.Having taught in schools for nearly 5 years you can get a sense about what is important to kids.*Facebook is not cool* = Subsequent rebranding and losing relevance *Tik tok very cool* = tik tok becoming the leading social platform for 12 - 45 yr olds.*The US Office is better than the UK Office* = US office now the only one streaming on Aus Netflix.I must confess 5 years ago I didnt hear any of the above. Facebook was (somehow) cool tik tok didnt exist and there was stiff competition for which Office series was better. Fast forward to today..Im teaching my Yr 9 commerce class and they ask **sir which crypto do you recommend buying?.**Students no longer laugh on this topic even 3 years ago they might have switched off. But not now. they are increasingly involved in crypto and are investing in it themselves. This is because it is both relevant and achievable for them to do so.Im telling you listen to what the youth is talking about; they are INTO crypto and that makes me bullish af.,710,0.89,621,2022-02-08 08:30:40

Everyone is talking about a dead cat bounce but do you know why it is called that?,So we keep hearing people arguing about if this uptrend is the beginning of a second leg bull run or that this uptrend is just a dead cat bounce.That made me wonder why it is called dead cat bounce. Is it a dead bounce from a living cat? Is it because the graph looks like a dead cat? Is it because a cat just like a chicken can bounce around for a little bit even when dead?So I Googles it and now you dont have to waste 30 seconds of graph staring or reddit scrolling to do it yourself.What I found is that it is called a dead cat bounce because of the old saying even a dead cat will bounce if you drop it from high enough.Seems pretty grim to me but thats why it is called what its called.,705,0.82,335,2022-01-25 13:24:22
Some good news for today. USDCs current supply on Ethereum is $40 billion vs USDTs $39 billion. The flippening is happening.,While many are interested in the ETH/BTC flippening I think the USDC/USDT one is just as important since it signifies that slowly but surely USDT will lose its powerful grip over the centralized exchanges.Would feel much safer knowing that the market isnt controlled by a shady coin like USDT and that other stablecoins with REAL 11 ratio like USDT EURST and UST have a chance in the market.From here on forward I dont think its going to take much time for this flippening to happen over the entire market not just Ethereum. Would be an amazing and well awaited day honestly.,698,0.94,154,2022-01-22 01:24:19
BTC has just undone a months worth of decline in 24 hours; this is why the crypto market is so entertaining,It never closes and thats probably where the obsession lies for so many theres no weekend or nighttime reprieve from the upticks and downticks. You know that when you go to bed and when you wake up in the morning something will have changed in your portfolio; things jump up or fall off of a cliff our of nowhere and youre just lying there thinking about what youre going to buy when it all works out (because it feels like an inevitability); you wake up and shrug off the -5% because youre sure that eventually itll be made up and it might not even take that long because of how quickly things seem to gain or lose momentum. At first its stressful but if you stick around you develop a kind of gallows humour where you just laugh and wait for the next day to come around to throw more coins into the money pit. Because one day you know youll have enough for that little impractical squashed-looking yellow car.,702,0.91,204,2022-02-05 11:20:25

51k btc just moved onto Binance today. Are we about to get dumped on?,51k BTC were just moved onto Binance today. Are we about to get dumped on?Thats a lot of fucken btc. I was hoping for a little pumpy wumpy after all the dumpy weve been handed…but something tells me whicer moved these btc arent using these for a leveraged longs theyre going to dump on the market.

Personally Im feeling positive but thats why Im asking… my optimism has tripped me up before!On a separate note Ive been considering the best way to prepare for these dips and corrections and Im wondering about consolidating coins into one or two safer projects that arent as heavily affected when I see a 5-10% dip over say 1-2 days. In the past that would have been BTC but Im not convinced its the right move now given how the dips seem to be affecting its price to similar degree when compared to well established alts.

The same in several other European countries.* Ukraine. Despite the chest thumping there will be no major conflagration in Ukraine. Russia cannot afford to lose face and will back down - whilst making a small grandiose gesture.* Putin has confirmed that Russia will NOT be banning crypto. That was obvious but its still bullish news.* BTC Futures are currently at 0.93 - the highest for some time. The markets have fully priced in the gradual phasing out of tapering and up to 4 x 0.25% rate increase this year.* Global supply chains are recovering faster than governments expected.

Its crazy how fast people lose faith in a long term investment,Any investor thats been in the market and made money knows that nothing matters but time. It is a fact that bitcoin trends higher with time. Therefore in a year or so we will be laughing at these prices. We all say were long term investing but I dont think people know what a long term investment means. This means no matter what happens YOU DO NOT SELL. Your scope is 5-10 years maybe even 3 but thats what a long term investment is. You dont just start selling at a loss at the first sight of trouble. Bitcoin trends up with time. If you want to win you must HODL and buy more. These are the times when millionaires are made. You will be rewarded for buying into fear. This is not hopium this is a fact. Throughout history whenever markets have crashed the ones that had money to buy the crash always came out on top. Nothing is lost until you sell.As much as this sub preaches buy high sell low. Profits are taken at the top not at the bottom. Bitcoin will survive and recover. However the people who bought alts that have no purpose but hype at ATHs are in for a rude awakening.,679,0.9,344,2022-01-21 08:37:49
Crypto has ruined all link sharing for me.,Im so absolutely terrified of scams and phishing that I wont even click on a link sent from my family or friends. Im serious. If I see the title in the link Ill google it myself. I get so many scam texts and automated calls; its insane! I delete everything immediately without opening it or listening to it. Its crazy that there are so many people out there seemingly living in this dark crypto world of theft and fraud; I feel like theres more now than ever.The sad thing about it is that it has diminished my trust in most everyone. As a result I approach all conversations cautiously always thinking theres an angle to mislead. It sucks because I know there are good people out there who really want to engage genuinely.Does anyone else feel this way?Edit I appreciate all of the positive feedback from everyone that can relate. As for the negative  you need a psychiatrist go touch grass take a break feedback; this sub is a place to foster discussion about the world of crypto and this is an aspect of that world. I understand that grifters and scammers have been around since the beginning of time but I think it has become exponentially worse. ,676,0.89,962,2022-01-27 13:03:31

The **same validators** are validating across multiple different networks - and it makes sense after all they can have dedicated hardware/marketing team/etc just to do that and honestly probably it is extremely profitable.And it creates one huge problem**We became dependent of a few set of people/companies that are validating transactions across multiple blockchains**And why is that a problem ? Well first off it becomes more and more a system we need to trust. A secondly it stops being **censorship resistant**. You see if govs across the world just wanted to delete bitcoin or monero from existence they couldnt. They would be able to tank the price probably but they wouldnt have that much of an effect because it would be very hard to keep looking for miners across the world if not impossible.But validators... it should be decentralized but it is not. You can easily see where most of these people live and honestly you can easily track basically all the validators of a network from their websites specially governments. It becomes so much easier from governments to become able to interfere with the blockchain and just like that **the censhorship resistance aspect of the blockchain technology no longer exists.**I know you wouldnt be able to just delete the blockchain by going after the validators. But you could have so much impact in basically.... **all proof-of-stake blockchains by doing so.** Anyways english is not my first language so im sorry for any grammar mistakes.I just wanted to share this with you guys and get some opinions on it.,661,0.86,800,2022-01-23 05:53:56

VISA reports 25% of companies want to accept bitcoin and crypto payments by 2022,Adoption of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC) is already well underway. However [research from Visa](https//www.reuters.com/technology/quarter-small-businesses-across-nine-countries-plan-offer-crypto-payments-visa-2022-01-12/) shows that 2022 has even more in store for mainstream crypto adoption. In fact a whopping 25% of small businesses in 9 different countries plan to start accepting crypto payments this year.&#x200B;**Companies exceed consumer expectations**The survey was conducted among 2250 small businesses in 9 different countries. These are the United States Canada Brazil Singapore Germany Ireland Russia the United Arab Emirates and Hong Kong. Also 1000 Americans and 500 residents in each country were asked for their opinions. In doing so the survey covers almost all continents and provides a nice picture of the average sentiment worldwide.Visa reports that 25% of these 2250 businesses plan to accept crypto payments by 2022. This is while among consumers only 13% expect companies to do so. Jeni Mundy global head of merchant sales at Visa states that more trust seems to be emerging*I think more people are more confident in crypto*&#x200B;**Interest in crypto especially outside North America**Furthermore the survey revealed that it is mainly companies outside North America that are interested in accepting crypto payments. In North America only 19% (US) and 8% (Canada) say they have these plans. In the United Arab Emirates Singapore Hong Kong and Brazil the percentage is as high as 30%. Even companies that do not want to accept crypto this year may change tack later. Indeed the survey also shows that three-quarters of companies believe that expanding payment options is fundamental to their business growth. Mundy argues that it is a natural evolution to accept crypto over time.&#x200B;**Visa happy with results**The results will be music to Visas ears. After all the payments giant is betting big on crypto. Last year for example it launched a crypto consulting service. In addition the company made a promise to continue supporting crypto.,669,0.96,311,2022-01-13 18:03:39
It will never sit right with me this double tax thing,9-5 people perhaps not living paycheck to paycheck but someone whos not more than half a year of unemployment away from having their life turned on its head - These people are not going to get much better off by working nor by saving money in the bank. They dont have wealthy relatives so theres no large inheritance coming their way and they definitely dont have the money for a downpayment on a permanent residence of their own.These individuals know this.So they put a little money into crypto hoping to make it grow a bit hoping to take charge a bit. This is money theyve already been taxed on. It is a risky endeavor but theyre assuming all the risk. It happens that they grow their $2000 worth of crypto into $5000 worth of crypto and theyre ecstatic! - but here comes the government it needs a cut.Why? Why now? Have they not already paid taxes on this money? The government assumed no risk. The money is still in crypto. Those $5000 can turn to $500 in a hurry. What happens then? Can they deduct it? Maybe it depends on where you live. At best you can deduct only a small percentage of your loss each year.So they have to pay taxes on the money theyve made from the money they had already paid taxes on even if they still risk losing all of it (+ taxes now).--If the government must tax crypto gains they had no stake in make it happen ONLY when the gains go back to fiat or when theyre exchanged into some other real-world asset like a car.Until then it is play money an unrealized gain (or loss) that the government has no business putting their noses in. Poker chips that have not yet been exchanged for cash.Sure as India did remove their ability to deduct anything. Its fine. As long as you dont try to tax their unrealized gains. Or do something stupid like taxing transactions...&#x200B;Edit - I know they only pay taxes on their gains not their initial.,661,0.75,864,2022-02-01 20:28:11

El Salvador Never invest more than your people can lose I guess?,I am pro-crypto for sure but I see many people in here praising the El Salvador/Crypto saga and I dont understand why? A week ago the Credit Rating Agency Moody downgraded El Salvadors sovereign bonds due to their irresponsible and crappy implementation of crypto. Do you know how president Nayib Bukele addressed the matter? By replying [BREAKING EL SALVADOR DGAF](https//twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1483194959989719059). Do you know who certainly GAF? The lenders that a country in a financial crisis like El Salvador heavily relies on. El Salvador is now down over $20 million since investing in BTC. This amount might not be a lot from your perspective but were talking about El Salvador for gods sake. One-third of Salvadorans cant afford food yet their crypto bro president is [day-trading](https//twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1467333081505976323) Crypto on his phone with tax money. Keep in mind I am not attacking crypto per se. I am addressing how bad the implementation is and how terrible the consequences can be. The whole thing was rushed and not discussed enough. There is no transparency at all and a lack of education on how bitcoin operates. A gov-run BTC wallet with so many reported hacking & vulnerabilities breaches along with a naïve Mass adoption & promising projects propaganda is not a good mix.As a country filled with unrest crime and corruption blind adoption is not a solution. Especially for developing countries facing many significant problems that put at risk the lives of their people. For many developing nations the failure of El Salvadors crypto vision will only confirm their doubts that adopting such technologies is ineffective. Mass adoption means nothing if the implementation is this crappy. Please stop glorifying a dictator whos objectively harming his own people and will eventually harm other nations perception of crypto.Thanks.,661,0.79,426,2022-01-22 14:32:01
Why you should make XMR part of your portfolio,Im sure that a lot of you have heard about Monero (XMR) and that it is [Private/Untraceable](https//imgur.com/a/Skb5L4q) and most commonly used in boating accidents but theres more to XMR then just that and its potential use cases are solid A lot of people seem to have this understanding that XMR is used solely for the purpose of buying illicit products on the dark web because its untraceable and yes that does happen but its also happened to Bitcoin before and now countries such as El Salvador have made BTC a national currency.XMR can be used for so much more then nefarious acts online for example buying everyday products and subscriptions/services.Why would you want to use XMR for that? Credit card fraud rose by 44.7% over 2019 to 393207 reports.There were 1108 data breaches in 2020The number of people affected by data breaches was 300Million in 2020 identity theft/fraud cases resulted in losses of $712.4 billion in 2020. That was a 42% increase from 2019.  [source](https//www.fool.com/the-ascent/research/identity-theft-credit-card-fraud-statistics/)Paying with a credit/debit card seems simple enough but your putting your information/finances at risk of being compromised and it is a headache to deal with compromised bank cards/credentials In comes XMR to solve these issues Since XMR is so private the risk of having your credit/debit card compromised by a data breech is virtually impossible because you never used the credit or debit card to buy the product/serviceOutside entities cannot decipher addresses trading monero transaction amounts address balances or transaction histories. This is all because of XMRs stealth addresses which obscures the public address to the people involved. This also goes hand in hand with XMRs ring signature technology which makes use of your account keys and a number of public keys pulled from the blockchain using a triangular distribution method. There is no way an outside observer can tell which of the possible signers in a signature group belongs to your account. XMR is so private in fact even the IRS has even offered a bounty of $625K to anyone who can crack the privacy of Monero. [source](https//blockchain.news/news/irs-criminal-investigation-$625-000-bounty-monero-privacy-crack-btc-lightning-network-tracker)On top of all that delicious technology that XMR has to offer it is also an open source and completely decentralized so anyone can partake in using XMR. No one is excluded.And the icing on the cake is that XMR is considerably much cheaper to transact with then Bitcoin. Plus all the added benefits with all the extra features that XMR has to offer. Transaction fees paid (last 100 transactions) [source](https//www.monero.how/monero-transaction-fees)Monero (lowest)	0.000007	$ 0.0010Bitcoin (lowest)	0.000027	$ 1.0647Monero (median)	0.000009	$ 0.0014Bitcoin (median)	0.000067	$ 2.5851Monero (highest)	0.006938	$ 1.0105Bitcoin (highest)	0.000450	$ 17.4929**TLDR you should use XMR wherever possible for your day to day transactions to mitigate your chances of having your credit/debit card and personal information from being compromised.** **Privacy is a human right**,656,0.84,507,2022-02-01 19:42:39

BBC and crypto media 20-year-old turned $50 into $8m by trading crypto token he set up has collected $250k for charity 😍 What they dont report is that token shut down in October and seemingly was a scam?,There is a wholesome story going around by the BBC today echoed by some crypto media about a young crypto millionaire that turned $50 into millions within months trading crypto. Okay this sound somewhat unbelievable but theres more to the story.They report he is giving back to the community and A cryptocurrency he set up to support charity has already seen more than £200000 spent on causes and he is looking to use further funds raised by his currency to realise his foodbank plans for his home town of Birmingham.The problem is that token shut down in October as a [Twitter user](https//twitter.com/jimwaterson/status/1491361991541538817) found out through a short search.

Over the next 24-48 hours dont make any rash decisions and sleep on your trade plans.,The sub is blowing up as BTC has dropped to a low we were not expecting etc etc.. FUD is dropping from left right and center and we are expecting a further contraction in the global markets. Yes the BTC $100k dream is long dead for now but that doesnt mean your investment isnt a good one. You still have the same amount of coins which historically should again achieve the price you bought them at.People need to try and stay calm if you plan on doing a trade it would be advisable to think about it maybe delay 24h and see if it still feels like the right decision. Emotion trading often leads to bad decisions.If you are feeling down definitely talk to family and friends for support.,634,0.91,515,2022-01-21 04:49:25
Ten years ago I predicted that Reddit would turn its karma system into crypto-currency. Heres my next ten-year prediction.,Blockchain tech is in the early stages of constructing a trustless global voting machine that humanity will use to quickly reach popular consensus on current events. Biometrics and facial recognition in VR headsets or AR glasses will be used to authenticate users to a specific wallet address guaranteeing that no user votes twice. This will lead to an informal global democracy. Ignoring or acting against the will of global consensus will be considered political taboo in many countries. Over time this voting mechanism will fundamentally transform the way in which humanity governs itself.Thank you for reading my silly prediction. Obligatory this is not financial advice but entertainment only. Proof of my last prediction is noted in the subreddits wiki under the crypto history section.,971,0.83,429,2022-02-09 16:17:49

For fucks sake. Decide if you are a trader or an investor.,I dont know why people dont understand this but being an investor is very different from being a trader.You are a trader if1. If you are after quick profit.2. You want to cash in on your investment by selling at a pre-determined price.3. You are constantly looking for promising buying opportunities.4. You love the thrill of a volatile market.You are an investor if you are1.looking for long term profit. 2. Dont want to spend much time/energy following price movements. 3. Want to sleep well at night.4. Willing to leave your money in one place for a long time.Now if you are an investor you should be ready to wait for the next bull run. So stop bitching about the prices and move on.If you are a trader then you should have minimized your losses at the start of the bear cycle. If you didnt then you clearly are not good at what you are doing.If you are a trader you should try using the hype around coins and sell without being too greedy. If you are an investor just ignore the hype! You want something with long term prospect. Just decide what you want to be and stick to it.Edit it seems I have to write another piece about why you cant be both soon. Half of what people say in comments about being both a trader and investor are actually still being only one of them.My understanding is most people here are short term investors. At least according to more than 300 comments I have read so far. And we have very very few actual traders in here.RegardsVve,632,0.76,781,2022-01-31 12:38:05

r/personalfinance continues to downvote any comments I make about staking stablecoins on exchanges for better returns than HYSA for banks. Some posts even lead to deletion for ‘rule breaking,Ive posted 2 comments on separate occasions where OP has lets say over $10k and wants their money to earn interest over time while also being liquid if they ever need it.I suggested that they look into stablecoins as the value is not going to be volatile and using the stablecoins to stake on an exchange platform. Speaking as a New Yorker I think the only platforms I can get this from an exchange are Coinbase and Gemini. Coinbase offers 4% for USDC and Gemini 8.05% GUSD. I mentioned how I have used Gemini the past 6 months getting interest compounded daily and just recently had a smooth transaction withdrawing my money from staking and coming in my bank account in what takes no longer than 2 weeks. I informed OP he should do his own research as it doesnt come without risk as the money is not FDIC insured so of course he should not be putting ALL his money in an account like this if he is not comfortable. Every time I am met with downvotes and people spreading misinformation about cryptocurrency in general. It just pisses me off how people can be so misinformed so confidently and stifling discussions. Have do you have the ignorance to boast that a .05% ‘high savings bank is the best offer in the market? Clearly they need to adjust however they get their information as the times are changing. Ill keep enjoying my stablecoins gains. )TLDR - r/personalfinance hates crypto as does 99% of all subs on RedditEdit I violated the rules on r/personalfinance and I shouldnt be shilling people on volatile suggestions when there are risk free options.

Bitboy,I like most of you newbies when I first wanted to get into crypto hopped on YouTube in January 2021 and searched some newbie phrase what should I do with 1k crypto and more than likely bitboy pops up with his promising titles and digestible content.  And at this time ETH was around 1500.  So I like any newbie not wanting to miss out on big gains aped in my 1k.  And although Ive turned out fine learned a lot had some losses but mostly gains I am still pretty pissed and disturbed by bitboys content.  Watching him guarantee a 10k ETH and 200k BTC by Sept. 2021 is fucking outrageous and I really dont understand how things like that are allowed.  All you really have to do is say NFA and youre in the clear to promise whatever you want? You can shill hopium to people who have no clue what theyre doing?

Top 10 crypto stereotypes,1. Bitcoin maximalist.Dude lives in 2012 and still believes that all coins that arent bitcoin are scams. He cant see value in any other project outside bitcoin and worship people like Michael Saylor. Brags about understanding Austrian school of economics but never really read Mises. Constantly makes comparisons about energy use of bitcoin vs banks and gold.2. The ethereum dude.He isnt a maximalist and actually enjoy other projects but thinks that ethereum is king. Consider the first mover advantage eth has over smart contracts too much to be overcome by other coins. Keep his coins at the exchange for obvious reasons.3. The Cardano geek.Usually they follow Charles Hoskinson like a cult. Live in a completely isolated world where all that exists is Cardano. They read through each whitepaper but never read about other projects outside of Cardano. They constantly brag about how Cardano is safe due to Haskell and how fast it can become with Hydra. Dont really do anything with his Cardano since theres nothing to do.4. The solana cheated wife.He knows the network is centralized. He knows it keeps getting offline. He knows how bad the initial token distribution was. But since he gained some money in Solana he is always looking for explanations about Solana problems and bragging about a zillion tps.5. The obsessed trader.He cant hold one coin for over one month. Hes always checking his charts and always getting hyped about new coins. He says hes into crypto for the long term but his average holding period is one week. Usually loses money.6. The CRO boomer.Uses the debit card and stake. Believes that CRO will be huge. Dont understand much about crypto in general but usually has lots of money and stake all his CRO to get shiny metal cards.7. The moonshooter.Hes always looking for the next big thing and very susceptible to YouTubers and influencers. Constantly shill his shitcoins at Reddit and social media. Usually loses money8. The FUDster.The crash is always incoming and hes always afraid of losing all his money. Deep down he believes that crypto is a Ponzi scheme. Usually hes at mid-age and hide his crypto investments from his wife. Every 10% dip he thinks the world is gonna end. Constantly talks about Tether.9. Buy high and sell low.He knows the theory but cant help to the opposite. He always FOMO at ATH and paperhand sell at lows. 10. The hodler.He doesnt really know much about tech details about the projects he invest in. He doesnt take profits nor take losses. He doesnt try to time the market. He just hodl. But that doesnt stop him from getting hyped up when he has unrealized gains and extremely worried when he has unrealized losses.Do you know anyone that are in these stereotypes ?Do you identify in one of them ?*sorry for any potential grammar mistakes. Im from Brazil and English is my second language.,610,0.85,472,2022-01-11 10:22:23

Take a look at it with a log scale[Not so sharp now](https//preview.redd.it/6rsncwcymjd81.png?width=2530&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e0a02b7e5377c2be4ddfc7cc4199055fa992ec5)OP posted a screenshot knit-picking the dot com bubble and mortgage crisis implying that there must be a crash/bear market every 10 years. Take a look at this chart where I overlayed the move from 1950-2000. A 50 year time period where the stock market sometimes went sharply up. This isnt even accounting for inflation. Obviously if trillions of dollars are printed the stock market will seem like it is going parabolic.[S&P Overlayed with move from 1950-2000](https//preview.redd.it/zabtdoelnjd81.png?width=2526&format=png&auto=webp&s=51991ec232403cd81cd324ca70ff2c02c7dc45db)As a final note I suggest you watch Ben Cowens video where he shows the stock market divided by the money supply. Its very interesting.# Market CapOP argued that the crypto market caps were too high. I think market cap in crypto is somewhat useful but also very silly metric in some cases especially in markets with **low liquidity** where it is very easy to manipulate (like many alt coins mentioned in the post).Market Cap = Price * SupplyKnowing this it is much easier to influence lower liquidity markets/coins.Example #1 If I create 1B poop coins and sell 1 of them for $1 the market cap will be 1B.Example #2 Lets say poopcoin has a supply of 1M. The current price is $1. There is 1 poopcoin for sale at $1 in the order book and the next poopcoin for sale in the order book is for $1.50.If I only buy 1 poopcoin my $1 order will increase the price of the coin to $1.50 thereby increasing the market cap from 1M to 1.5M.On the other hand if there are 500k poopcoins for sale at $1 and I buy 400k the price will remain at $1 meaning my $400k order wouldnt have moved the market cap at all.The point is you cant compare crypto market caps to stock market caps. Theyre two very different entities.# ConclusionIn conclusion I think OP is spreading unnecessary FUD.The Fed isnt stupid. I dont believe they will purposefully cause a recession. Wall street is just reacting to the fact that rates might go up which is causing them to de-risk.Obviously there is a possibility for us to go into a bear market Im not denying that. Im just saying that we dont know whats going to happen and I dont think spreading unnecessary fear is going to help.,600,0.86,216,2022-01-24 02:46:09
Crypto companies publishing research reports showing crypto is not at all bad for the environment feels like cigarette companies making doctors say that smoking is totally not bad for you in the 1930s,Today (maybe a few days ago? I saw it posted today) a company called CoinShares published [a report](https//coinshares.com/research/bitcoin-mining-network-2022) that tries really hard to push the narrative that BTC is totally not bad for the environment and that all of that is FUD.Who is CoinShares? A company whose mission is to expand access to the digital asset ecosystem - in other words a company that is dependent on crypto succeeding. If you read the report and you dont have rose-colored glasses that becomes obvious for you - even though they pick the numbers most favorable for them they find that BTC accounts for only 0.08% of CO2 emitted worldwide.Think about that thats almost a thousandth of all CO2 - for something that really isnt used all that much. That number is huge and probably even higher in reality.Its a laughable effort of declaring BTCs environmental problems FUD. In a few decades when we hopefully have mostly solved cryptos environmental problems we will look back at studies like that the same way we regard [cigarette ads from the 1930s and 1940s](https//www.history.com/news/cigarette-ads-doctors-smoking-endorsement) with doctors saying they are not at all bad for your health.Change my mind!,601,0.76,513,2022-02-03 09:15:22
Why most of you wont get rich from crypto?,This isnt a rant post but a reminder that most people here wont get rich from crypto. I have seen tons of HODL and DCA posts during the past 1 year. They make sense to most of the new investors when you see the market retrospectively. It seems very lucrative and missed opportunity at the same time when we zoom out and see Coin X making 50X gains coin Y making 100X gains in a year.But theres another harsh truth that seems to pop out when you zoom out on the charts. Its that when the markets plummet then Hodling isnt easy and many people think that buying at such times is crazy.So if you arent in crypto for longer run and invested already too much beyond your limits then this volatile market is not for you.Invest what you can and never beyond what you cant let the dust settle markets will rise again sometime in future.,599,0.8,801,2022-01-24 03:55:48
Why Facebook should not be allowed to enter/succeed in the metaverse. The truth behind Facebooks Rebranding,In yesterdays Facebook earnings report of 2021 Q4 this is what they disclosed about future earning projections.`We expect first quarter 2022 total revenue to be in the range of $27-29 billion which represents 3-11% year-over-year growth. We expect our year-over-year growth in the first quarter to be impacted by headwinds to both impression and price growth.`* `On the impressions side we expect continued headwinds from both increased competition for peoples time and a shift of engagement within our apps towards video surfaces like Reels which monetize at lower rates than Feed and Stories.` * `On the pricing side we expect growth to be negatively impacted by a few factors`   * `First we will lap a period in which Apples iOS changes were not in effect and we anticipate modestly increasing ad targeting and measurement headwinds from platform and regulatory changes.`   * `Second we will lap a period of strong demand in the prior year and were hearing from advertisers that macroeconomic challenges like cost inflation and supply chain disruptions are impacting advertiser budgets.`   * `Finally based on current exchange rates we expect foreign currency to be a headwind to year-over-year growth.`So Apples Ask App not to track feature has negatively affected Facebooks ad revenue and ad campaigns as they cant track these users anymore steal their data and making money off of targeted ads more efficiently.And as Zoomers are more into tik tok reels based ads have lower monetization rate.So what does Zucc do? Zucc is thinking about creating their own metaverse kinda like Sandbox or Decentraland but with actual VR and monetize it by playing ads(Like how people are buying lands in Sandbox and Mana to advertise their business) and stealing more data from users.This is because they realized since they will not have a majority chunk of iphone users data which is always a big part of their revenue because majority of the United States use iphone and ad rates are better for Western countries rather than third world countries Zucc realized he cant control mobile devices anymore hence he wants his own Matrix style Dystopian Metaverse with targeted ads.Facebook has literally shaped how modern society is. The harm what facebook has done and is continuing to due on many fronts to the population is irreversible. Facebook should not be allowed to succeed in its Metaverse plans.Sincerely FUCK FACEBOOK!

All hell is about to break loose. $500k. 100% of my dip money going all in.,&#x200B;&#x200B;https//preview.redd.it/m5tw25x8b6b81.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a6d98a65a43a4646795b73789b8f0963894b0638&#x200B;Ive watched on-chain data for years. Id argue that currently its the most bullish Ive ever seen it and the micro backdrop looks the same. Im calling for $500k in the next 12 months. Longterm holders are in a longterm uptrend while short-term holders are in a longterm downtrend. When you consider the halving we had in 2020 (which means only 6.25 coinbase per block) the rise of commercial mining (which means huge amounts of HODLed bitcoin) the parabolic growth of the LN (which means ever increasing amounts of BTC locked in nodes) the explosion of hard wallets (Trezor will give you 13% off if you wait to buy yours and Ledger tripled its capacity) the possibility of spot ETFs (which means pension IRA and institutional exposure) and that 90% of all BTC has already been mined  (the last 10% will take over 100 years to mine) theres not much time left until we reach the counterpoint. Thats where governments financial institutions and wealthy families late to what weve known as inevitable compete for the last large tracts of UTXO space on the blockchain and bring about the type of volatility that the gold/papiermark enjoyed just before bitcoins transactional (medium of exchange) epoch arrives&#x200B;https//preview.redd.it/dtjkna3cb6b81.png?width=601&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c5a310fb1c2c31678582e086a9bd05b54236542On the micro side all the publicly listed bitcoin companies (miners FinCen etcetera) are at exhausted RSIs and trading at or below 52-week lows. The perp funding rates are negative. Futures ETFs have been in a consistent downtrend since November. The fear and greed index reached multi-year lows two days ago. Too the massive amount of Asian selling is drying up (Huobi alone dumped 350k coins over the last quarter and several exchanges dumped all their Chinese customers). But youd never know any of this from the story on-chain data is trying to tell us that dumb money isnt heedinghttps//preview.redd.it/stqgygmyb6b81.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=78ae90722bc8c98455aef5e353d922f4e7a49591&#x200B;https//preview.redd.it/p7bjjtv7c6b81.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a10a5ca31e4c4e6028b53172221bd5f3649bf758So for me Im going to follow the subtext and not listen to the noise. Im going to trust the math. Im going all-in with my dip money which I usually keep at 5% of my BTC holdings. Ill do so un-hedged and prepare a loan on my BTC in the event one of the below FUDs drives us down briefly.**FINAL FUD**There are 3 potential FUDs this year and after there wont be anymore ever.* Regulation. This will obliterate altcoins and almost all stablecoins.* Mt. Gox distribution date* Russian invasion of Ukraine. This could spike energy prices clobber minings economy of scale and force distribution of several miners holdings to pay overhead. Kazakhstan produces energy at .04-.05 cents per kWh which is about the cheapest in the world and has 20% of the hash power for example. Adding .01 to that is extremely severe.Bitcoin will pivot off all of this quickly.,2932,0.8,1120,2022-01-12 03:31:09

New bill just introduced in the House and which will very likely pass in some form is a provision that would be disastrous,^(Jerry Brito)Included in the America COMPETES Act just introduced in the House and which will very likely pass in some form is a provision that would be disastrous not just for bitcoin but for privacy and due process generally. https//preview.redd.it/yd6ndzcdr2e81.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f30615c6ce3bb070f5d57d6b9c1e70591efdde1 The so-called special measures provision would essentially give the Treasury Secretary unchecked and unilateral power to ban exchanges and other financial institutions from engaging in cryptocurrency transactions. How would it do this? https//preview.redd.it/oe75dflgr2e81.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc361154d9da4c892574720e50f0dc4368375cc0Bank Secrecy Act §5318A allows the Secretary to identify a primary money laundering concern and take special measures to (1) require financial institutions to report information on the concern and/or (2) prohibit FIs from maintaining accounts related to the concern.  Special measures authority is vast power that the Secretary of the Treasury has today so in the current statute there are checks on that power. First the law requires that Treasury engage in a public rulemaking before instituting a prohibition. Second the secretary can impose a surveillance special measure through a simple order but its duration is limited to 120 days and must be accompanied by a public rulemaking.  While not full due process these limitations at least alert the public and gives the public some opportunity to comment on a special measures merit or constitutionality.  The new provision would do three things  -Add certain transmittal of funds to the list of things that can be banned by the Secretary  -Eliminate all public notice and comment requirements  -Eliminate the 120-day limitation for measures imposed without regulation &#x200B;https//preview.redd.it/xhvownvlr2e81.jpg?width=583&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a2e0bc4cc2f6777391e35e447099fc21d8a8c1b7 If adopted into law this provision would be disaster not just for crypto but for privacy and democratic public process related to *all* types of financial transactions.  It empowers the Secretary to prohibit any (or indeed all) cryptocurrency transactions (or any other kind of transaction) without any process rulemaking or limitation on the duration of the prohibition.  This provision was first introduced as an amendment to the national Defense Authorization Act last year  https//preview.redd.it/n8eg358pr2e81.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=08418895f5e69fd1104c27b73c7a0e003b87a01d After alerting folks in the House and Senate of that amendments unintended consequences it was removed from the final bill that passed. Unfortunately its back verbatim without any improvements.  It still strips out *all* administrative process and duration limitations on the Secretarys power to condition or prohibit transactions at financial institutions associated with primary money laundering concerns.  Its time to call your member of Congress and ask that they take action to make sure that notice and comment and duration limitations are not removed from 31 U.S.C. § 5318A as the America COMPETES Act would do.,2906,0.94,762,2022-01-26 18:26:17

Lessons Ive learned after 7 years of hodling.,Back in late 2014 I bought my first coins heres what Ive learned since… 1. Hodling is simple but it isnt easy.2. When you get rich very few will be genuinely happy for you. Try to keep your success as quiet as possible.3. Consistency is key.4. DCA + smash buying helps soothe emotional volatility.5. Have a plan and stick to it. 6. The mainstream news is always hilariously wrong about bitcoin.7. Shitcoins are a high risk / high reward proposition.8. DONT TRADE. But If you are going to trade you need to measure your performance in bitcoin terms. 9. Mining is a profession not a hobby. 10. Frugality is paramount. If people arent laughing at your lifestyle you probably arent hodling or stacking hard enough.,2493,0.92,902,2022-01-11 14:52:11

The IMFs behavior towards El Salvador only further justifies the very existence and absolute necessity of Bitcoin for the world,El Salvador is a sovereign country that has the full right to choose how it wants to act to build a better future for its people.Nayib Bukele chose Bitcoin to try to change the future of his country. Under the current system El Salvador was condemned to survive by begging for aid from the IMF or the World Bank.Nayib Bukele understood the why of Bitcoin and decided to seize this opportunity to change the future of El Salvador and its people. The people of El Salvador overwhelmingly support Nayib Bukele in what he is trying to do for the country.El Salvadors bold choice has already changed the way the country is seen around the world. Everyone is talking about El Salvador and more and more entrepreneurs will be coming to El Salvador to participate in this experiment of building the first Bitcoin Nation.Who knew where El Salvador was before Nayib Bukele made this choice? Very few people. No one was talking about El Salvador. Bitcoin is already a game-changer for El Salvador and this is clearly just the beginning.While the IMF or the World Bank scoffed at Bitcoin a few years ago now these institutions are getting scared by the growing possibility that the Bitcoin experiment will succeed in El Salvador and motivate other countries to follow Nayib Bukeles path.Tonga is talking about adopting Bitcoin by the end of 2022 as are other countries in South and Central America. In short something is happening and the IMF feels the danger mounting for its obsolete system.Rather than letting the people determine for themselves the IMF is threatening El Salvador saying the country must abandon Bitcoin. The IMFs threats only justify in my opinion the very existence of Bitcoin and the absolute necessity for the world to have this alternative system available.Since El Salvador will logically refuse to obey the IMF whats next? Will America eventually orchestrate a coup in El Salvador to overthrow the government and end the Bitcoin experiment? How far are the powerful people in the current system willing to go to prevent countries from expressing their free will in monetary and financial matters?El Salvador must continue to resist outside pressure and other countries that will join the Bitcoin adventure in 2022 must do the same. The world is changing and the first countries to adopt Bitcoin will be the ones to benefit the most in the future.,1258,0.95,400,2022-01-26 10:08:59

The Russian government and the Bank of Russia have agreed to regulate cryptocurrencies like currencies not assets,The Bank of Russia wanted the Russian government to declare the use of cryptocurrencies illegal in Russia but instead of banning the use cryptocurrencies the Russian government and the Bank of Russian have agreed that cryptocurrencies will be recognized as an analogue of currencies in Russia and they will be regulated as such.From this newspaper that is nationally distributed in Russia https//www.kommersant.ru/doc/5206307The government and the Bank of Russia have agreed on a future regime for the circulation of cryptocurrencies in Russia before February 18 they will prepare a draft law on the circulation of digital currencies in the Russian Federation in which cryptocurrencies are recognized as an analogue of currencies and not digital financial assets (DFA). Their circulation in the legal sector will be possible only with full identification through the banking system or licensed intermediaries. Operations equivalent to more than 600 thousand rubles must be declared transactions outside the legal sector for such amounts will become a criminal offense and an aggravating circumstance under the Criminal Code fines will be introduced for the illegal acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment. Mining and related issues of DFA are not affected by the concept within which the project is being prepared.The government after meetings with Deputy Prime Minister Chief of Staff of the White House Dmitry Grigorenko published the approved Concept for regulating the mechanisms for organizing the circulation of digital currencies. Recall that the White House has been discussing the new status of cryptocurrencies and digital currencies in the Russian Federation since the summer of 2021 in January 2021 a road map was created on this issue the Bank of Russia made a consultative report proposing to ban the circulation of cryptocurrencies in the Russian Federation the Ministry of Finance - with its own development on this topic. The final concept is mainly based on the positions of the Ministry of Finance.Until February 18 the ministry and the Bank of Russia must formulate either a separate bill or amendments to the law on the CFA and other laws for its implementation.The details of the transition period as well as mining are not discussed by the concept. Meanwhile they are quite important the regulation of turnover will require quick decisions from cryptocurrency owners - whether they should move into the emerging legal market segment get rid of such assets or stay in the illegal sector. The main difference between the concept which in fact implements the Central Banks strong distrust of cryptocurrency is the proposal to develop amendments to the Criminal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure according to which evasion of declaring transactions with cryptocurrency will become a criminal offense and its use will become an aggravating circumstance in other offenses.The possession of cryptocurrency in the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation and transactions with it (as well as with the dollar) are not prohibited - but only through the organizer of the digital currency exchange system (a bank with a universal license) or a p2p exchanger legalized in the Russian Federation. The mode of operation of the legal segment involves the full identification of the client according to banking rules work taking into account AML / CFT requirements all information about transactions through the Transparent Blockchain system of Rosfinmonitoring will be available for state control in the same way as transactions with non-cash rubles or foreign currency on bank accounts. The mode of control over transactions with the cryptocurrency of natural persons however is described by the concept as not too different from the mode of control over cash transactions with any currency. Most likely the main argument for was that in the USA the EU and Japan they are inclined to the same or to strict bans as in China which was also proposed by the Bank of Russia.So far the most intriguing is the organization of the legalization of the existing undeclared cryptocurrency which is not described in the concept. Market participants have no doubts that the possibilities of working with legal crypto in the implementation of the concept are adequate. The same part of the owners who prefer to remain in the sector illegal for the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation depends on the future taxation of operations with cryptocurrencies (from the meaning of the concept it follows that it should not differ from the principles of holding foreign currency) and on the rules of legalization. The Ministry of Finances estimate of the total amount of crypto assets in the Russian Federation has not changed - it is 12 million crypto wallets with assets worth 2 trillion rubles. It is decidedly unknown whether this figure takes into account the cryptocurrency used in the criminal sector obviously.,947,0.98,159,2022-02-09 07:32:18

I flew to El Salvadors Bitcoin Beach for 4 days… heres what I learned…,I went to El Salvador with no expectations. When I first landed it felt hot lovely. Had to wait for a friend so I grabbed the rental car where they try and scam you for insurance and went for a coffee. Friend arrived and we drove to El Zonte a.k.a Bitcoin Beach.The drive we thought we were going to be shot not sure why but you hear stories. We didnt get shot. Checked in the Airbnb no probs no hot water though.Next day we drive to the beach for coffee and bump straight into Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert said hi Stacy was nice but Max was not interested I probably wouldnt be to be fair especially when Im after a coffee.Bitcoin signs everywhere talked to a bunch of people and some knew about bitcoin but mostly not felt like just a lot of travellers there passing through. I think all the stuff you see online you assume everyone is walking around with Chivo wallets but it doesnt seem to be the case maybe other places its like that but not here.We contacted some estate/realtor agents and saw two properties just to see whats available this place literally has nothing when I say nothing I mean youll need to put water in electricity its so behind the times that most people here live in tin shacks by the road/river. It seems that theres chancers there trying their luck to get bitcoiners to buy shacks but there really isnt any point… the reality is you cant either not straight forward anyway as youll need a lawyer and even if you buy something youre not 100% sure you own it its confusing plus the government has some rule where they can take property off people.My thoughts are this wont be the future of Bitcoin its so behind the times. The people were lovely beautiful scenery great weather but realistically this place will take 20 years to develop and in the next couple of years there will most likely be other countries adopting Bitcoin countries which are already developed.El Salvador is definitely cool and will probably the Mecca/pilgrimage place for the future of where it all started to be accepted but I cant see it being anything but that. I actually hope Im wrong because it was first and deserves so much more but after visiting and seeing how undeveloped it is Id be very surprised if people actually go there.If anyone has been to San Salvador and people are daily using their Chivo wallets then please comment I hope there is more use of it as I read millions of people have them but whether theyre active accounts would be interesting to know.The last thing I want to say is this trip has made me realise how truly early we are still… one place is using Bitcoin and its underdeveloped. I cant imagine what Bitcoin will be like when everyone is using it… it blows my mind! Its so early.,809,0.92,415,2022-01-27 02:44:01

Do you think peoples psychology of investing in Bitcoin would change drastically if it were priced in Satoshis rather than Bitcoin? (44K = 1 BTC; 0.00044 = 1 Sat),I was just thinking that if someone just learned about Bitcoin and wanted to invest that the price of 44k (at the time of writing) for 1 BTC might deter some people from investing since they might think theres no way Ill ever own 1 BTC. But if the price was being presented and talked about in terms of Satoshis would a lot more people be willing to invest? Would we get more of the shitcoin investors willing to buy into bitcoin? I know the math is all the same but the psychology of investing $100 and getting 0.0022727273 of something (btc) doesnt seem as appealing as investing $100 and getting 227272.73 of something (sats) does. And I think a lot of people who invest in shitcoins like that they can own thousands or millions of something and hope the price rises. If people looked at the price of 1 sat (0.00044) would they be more or less willing to invest? Curious what people think about this?,604,0.92,395,2022-01-12 21:46:04

Understanding the upcoming inflation and why it wont be transitory !,You have probably heard of the money printer going BRRRRRR during the pandemic and the currently high inflation resulting from that. You may have also heard that the US federal reserve Bank (FED) and probably also the European Zentral Bank (EZB) are going to raise interest rates in the coming years to put everything to normal.This is what central bankers and high ranked politicians currently want you to belief maybe some of them believe it themselves but it doesnt change the fact that it is a straight lie ! We are about to witness an unprecedented inflation period affecting the entire western world.To prevent the whole system from collapsing these authorities are doing the only thing they can. It is necessary to stretch this period over several years keep the masses calm during the process of devaluation. This is why they assure you it is only transitory / we are raising interest rates and this will fix it / ... and so on. Sadly this is complete BS.Here is the real situationThe FED and especially the EZB were buying government bonds with freshly printed money for years to allow governments to spend money they dont have without paying interest on it. The pandemic was only the big final topping of a long term development that started after the 2008 crash. The amount of bonds the central banks are sitting on is enormous. Since 2008 the FED three-folded the amount of Dollar in existence and the EZB even six-folded the amount of Euro in existence. This money has already been created. This is not something that could eventually happen in the future. It has already happened.In classic economy theory it was assumed that an increase in the amount of money will directly result into inflation. But how was it then possible that they printed and spend these gigantic amounts of fresh money without causing inflation until now ? The answer to that was given by the work of the economist John Maynard Keynes (so called liquidity trap). The short version is that depending of the current state of economy freshly minted money is not causing instant inflation because its rather accumulated instead of put into the system. The result can be imagined like some kind of slow trickle down effect from the freshly minted money into the system which can take years. The real inflation will first appear once the new money trickled down into the circulation spheres of the average people. But this is not a matter of if its a matter of when. The now starting inflation is basically the beginning of this trickle down effect reaching the financial spheres of average people. But sadly it is only the first tip of a giant amount that is yet to come. No raise of interest rate will prevent this it will only slow it down. Ultimately the money is printed and its just a matter of time until it trickles down. With that in mind we can try to make a rough estimate of the overall inflation ahead of us. The FED three-folded the amount of Dollar in existence and the EZB even six-folded the amount of Euro in existence. Therefore once everything which is already printed yet has trickled down the Dollar value will decrease to a third and the Euro value will decrease to a sixth. Depending on the time frame they manage to stretch the process some of the inflation will be eaten up by economic growth if there is one. However including housing energy transportation and so on and not only the basic food basket used by the government we can probably still expect around a decade with a real average annual inflation north of 8% in the US and even more in the EU.As already said a raise of interest rates wont prevent this because the money is already there. It has just not trickled down yet. A raise in interest rates only slows the process down because the entities (mostly Banks) that are currently sitting on all that money are less eager to spend it when they get interest on it. But this is only stretching it. Having it stretched over a longer period of years just makes the whole thing more digestible.There is only one way to actually prevent this whole thing from happening but this wont or cant be done. The central banks would need to sell these giant stacks of bonds they obtained and take the money back out of circulation (burning it) before it can trickle down. The problem with this is that would crush the entire bond market. This would lead to the majority of the balance sheets of all Banks becoming worthless and countries having to pay real interest rates again when borrowing money which most of them cant afford anymore. Ultimately this would bankrupt the whole western banking industry and probably also a lot of entire countries in the western world. Whole industries currencies and maybe even societies would collapse. Or in other words 2008 would look like a small correction compared to this.I dont think I have to further explain why this is not an option. The way this will be played is to stretch it over a long time period to distribute the impact over years and being able to keep the majority calm until it is done. You will see after a few years it will be the new normality to have this kind of inflation and the majority plus the media wont even care anymore. The value of the giant amounts of generational debt our governments and societies have created over the last decades will melt away. It will be a consolidation but also the biggest transfer of wealth witnessed in the younger history.With this knowledge it is about you to position yourself correctly in the upcoming era of inflation. The majority of the bill will be paid by ordinary people having a few thousand bucks in their saving accounts and low wage earners which wont get a sufficient raise in salary to compensate. The rich and wealthy have the majority of their wealth in equity and other goods. Some even have debt in Dollar on the other side. This is how you profit the most from whats coming up. Just look at Microstrategy for example. Creating Dollar debt in exchange for a scarce asset (Bitcoin). Debt devalues and the asset increases in value.I am not trying to advocate taking debt here but everybody should at least think about not keeping significant amounts of money in currency over the next decade. Saving accounts are completely off limits in my opinion. If you are thinking about buying a flat or a house now is probably the perfect time. Other possibilities to position yourself to protect hard earned value of your money are Gold Stocks or of course Crypto.Thank you for reading this long text and I hope it was somehow interesting for you.**TL;DR The current Inflation is absolutely not transitory. It will last for years and probably become a new normality. You should position yourself to protect the hard earned value of your money.**,569,0.94,269,2022-01-12 16:38:05

Economics professor asked whats the point of bitcoin?,Today at my university class the professor asked whats the point of bitcoin? The room was somewhat silent then some responses about it being purely for speculation pop corned around the room. I sat in silence while he proceeded to slander btc and state multiple points of false information such as originally the creator pegged bitcoin at 1 us dollar and never meant for it to be priced the way it is also its backed by nothing unlike this physical dollar in my pocket. Clearly he doesnt understand bitcoin but i wonder what would have been the best response to such a question.,540,0.91,565,2022-02-01 06:08:02
I opened a company that rents private planes and accepts BTC 🙌,I have been traveling the world for 5 years on a small income from my medical retirement from the military and met an amazing woman in South America. We just opened a private charter jet company (she has been working in this space for 6 years). And we proudly accept BTC. I once saw the power in using crypto when I paid for part of my stay at a hotel in Colombia where my payment hit their account in minutes. The banking system is too slow. And they have too much power over our money. I will be having meetings with other brokers and charter jet providers about accepting Bitcoin too.

SEC repeatedly rejecting spot ETF while approving Futures is a blatant attempt to grab regulatory authority. The SEC is not acting in the interests of the people it is sworn to protect,Just now the SEC rejected the Fidelity spot ETF application with the usual concerns about manipulation. How can the spot ETF suffer from manipulation risk when the SEC themselves allowed the futures ETF which according to them doesnt suffer from manipulation? Both of them are the same market. Lets say US retail and institutions who the SEC wants to protect have invested in BITO.. and over the weekend when BITO isnt traded someone unknown to the market borrows a ton of money and also dumps million BTC on Bitfinex and crashes the price. Manipulation.. probably? But it doesnt make BITO free from manipulation on Monday when it trades BITO will just follow the spot price and dumps as well.Even BITO would be manipulated.So manipulation in spot - the SEC must protect but manipulation in CME futures as a result of spot manipulation is fine? How does it even make sense?Manipulation bs is just a big smokescreen to hide what the SEC really wants.. The real reason is that the SEC wants to control and exert authority over spot exchanges. Thats what DADDY gensler wants and this is all soft power play from a corrupt regulator acting in his own interest not in the interest of the people. Spot exchanges unless they are trading securities are not under the purview of the SECURITIES exchange commission. Bitcoin is not a security and does not fall under SECs purview under any stretch of mental gymnastics. Bitcoin futures have already been held as commodities. It literally makes zero sense that CFTC regulates Bitcoin futures but SEC regulates spot. Yet the SEC is trying to arm twist both the people and Congress to give regulatory authority over spot exchanges to the SEC. A regulator must act in the interests of the people not in the interest of the office. A regulator cant make power play so that the regulator gets more authority from Congress.Imagine if the last mile electricity supply company cut off power supply to the city because they dont have the authority to fix prices? Everyone would be up in arms.,453,0.97,62,2022-01-27 18:07:47

Bukele and Erdogan are plotting against the IMF,Remember that meeting that took place between Erdogan and Bukele last week? If you dont you will probably read about it in the history books for it may have been one of the most important meetings in modern history.Granted this is reddit so I dont have any proof but it makes a lot of sense so follow alongErdogan has been orange pilled. I think he as well as anyone realizes that American empire is collapsing. There is zero appetite for any military action *anywhere* and barring some Pearl Harbour-like event I dont see the US going to war for anything.So the world police has left the station and theyre not coming back. When America is no longer interested in world affairs all of the institutions America built during the post-war era will fall as well. The purpose of institutions like the IMF and the World Bank was always to serve Americas interests ideological or Machiavellian. Without the US steering the ship they will be lost and eventually rendered completely neutered. It will be like the Oscars of politics; no one will even care enough to notice when its finally gone.This of course leaves a huge power vacuum in all sorts of different avenues especially in international trade. Through the Petrodollar system all oil trade around the world settles in USD. This gave the US immense soft power since all oil importing countries like Turkey are forced to acquire dollars somehow and if they want to acquire dollars they have to follow Americas wishes. If they didnt want to adhere to the rules of the Petrodollar they were free to join Saddam Hussein and Gaddafi six feet down under.But like weve already established; the US wont do another Iraq nor another Libya. There is so little appetite for war that I believe that any attempt to start one might be enough to ignite a domestic revolution. The time for countries to free themselves from the Petrodollar is ripe.Countries like Turkey then have two options; Either they enter a similar agreement with China and let China become the new global super power who gets to call the shots.or they will build alternative systems where no single super power is in control.I think it is fairly obvious what alternative is preferable for anyone who isnt Chinese. The only question is *how* would anyone be able to build institutions that can withstand Chinese pressure?Enter bitcoin. Here one might question whether the ideals of bitcoin are compatible with an increasingly authoritarian Turkish government. I dont think however that Erdogan nor any other leader is particularly ideological. They want to stay in power of course but *how* they do so isnt the central focus. Anyone who lives in a country that has been bullied by super powers knows the shame it brings to the people. It is one thing to be pushed around by one of your own but to be pushed around by foreigners? A million times worse. If leaders of smaller countries like Erdogan Bukele etc. manage to free their countries from American control *without* entering a similarly abusive relationship with China they will forever be entrenched in the nations collective memory and they realize this. Bitcoin is their opportunity to do precisely that. In my opinion it is their only option. They will never be able to convince any other country of joining an international monetary network that themselves control. But convincing other countries to join a network *no one* controls might actually not be a very difficult task for the reasons stated above. Every single country in the world are sick and tired of getting bullied by America and the last thing they want is to be bullied by a new super power regardless of how authoritarian the regime might be. Bitcoin is the key that solves this puzzle. Bukele was the first head of state to come to this realization. He will not be the last.TLDR;The 20th century was the era of centralisation. With the fall of the American empire we will enter an era of decentralisation. All the pieces are in play and now we are just waiting for the dominos to fall.To finish this Id like to end with a quote from Erdogan from last month>Turkey will never again submit its political and economic future to the prescriptions of global economic tutelage institutions such as the IMF and similar institutions>https//www.aa.com.tr/en/politics/turkey-will-never-submit-its-economic-future-to-imf-president-erdogan/2435775Sounds familiar?,444,0.87,322,2022-01-26 11:51:56

am i the only one who hates using satoshi as the unit of bitcoin?,like i get that satoshi is homage to bitcoins creator (even though that probably isnt their name) but it just doesnt feel like it fits well. bitcoin is such a beautiful logical and ingenious name thats rolls of the tongue (as i would expect from the genius that invented and named it) but satoshi just isnt and doesnt—especially when pronouncing it sats. i always felt like bits made perfect sense a bitcoin is a coin made up of bits and 100 million bits make up a bitcoin—bits and coins digits and money together in perfect harmony. it sounds like something straight out of a videogame too that coffee will be 10000 bits. versus that coffee will be 10000 sats. and if you divide further you get millibits and mbits which is still easy to say and still sounds cool versus millisatoshi and msats.  i saw that apparently bits was proposed for a unit of 100 sats but thats just unnecessarily complicated; in america we use dollar whether its $1 or $100 or $1 billion and it works just fine. im sure its a losing battle but the word satoshi just sucks aesthetically and linguistically and i hate it.edit yes bits is also the name for the most basic unit of data but falls in line with what .00000001 btc is and makes perfect sense as the word for a basic unit of money;  run and set have over a combined 1000+ different usages and yet we use them just fine without confusion. some of you act like satoshi shouldve literally named bitcoin digital money.,430,0.66,671,2022-01-15 04:07:48

Im a bank teller at a large North American Bank and every day Im reminded how much we need Bitcoin.,EDIT Yes fraud is a tough subject and will be a hard problem to solve with crypto however we cant simultaneously say wide Bitcoin adoption is 5-10+ years away without expecting to have 5-10+ years of development that needs to be done to solve some of these things.As someone who works for a bank in a customer-facing retail setting Im one of the first people they come to when they have banking issues they need help with or complaints with our policies.These issues/complaints include any and all of the following- Credit/debit card fraud in which their card is being used without their permission.- Card fraud in which their card/personal details where stolen either through phishing or a similar scam.- Cards being locked due to suspicious transactions(which might not even be suspicious in many cases which just frustrates people)- Checks being put on hold for anywhere between 1-6 business days or even up to 10 for big checks.- Accounts being partially frozen or even closed due to potential fraud activity.- Payment apps like Zelle either not letting people link their accounts or blocking payments due to lack of similar payment activity or whatever they deem suspicious activity- Customer cannot easily transfer funds from their old bank to ours because the other bank has no local branches- Customers wanting large withdrawals but dont we dont have enough cash on hand to give it all to one customer- National coin shortage causing frustration for business customers- Wire transfer fees/processing time- Maintenance fees- Overdraft fees- Bank check/money order fees- Non-customer fees- Non-customer ATM fees- Non-transactional account transfer fees- Pending transactions taking days to post- Real companies making charges on peoples cards when they havent even been there in months- People complaining the ATM doesnt work after they just stuffed dozens of shitty dirty bills and water stained checks in it- A couple deposited all their money via bank check from their old bank and it was put on hold for over a week leaving them with no money.- Woman wanted to wire $100 to her family but was turned away because Intl wires cost $50 off the top and may or may not have fees on the receiving bank as well.- Guy couldnt access his money from his old bank across the country which required him to physically be there to initiate a wire.- Guy lost a fairly large bank check in the parking lot a few plazas over and took weeks to get in contact with him to put a stop on it.- Checks/cards not showing up in the mail wasting peoples time to have to come in and reorder and put stops on the lost items.- Old people who literally pay money to buy checks only to drive to the bank stand in line and write themselves a check for $100 cash  and ask for a balance - only to repeat this every other day.----------The fact that these problems and inconveniences even exist is a problem in itself. Bitcoin fixes all of these because they are completely irrelevant on a Bitcoin system. In economics 101 they teach you that the definition of an efficient market is one where **all information is transmitted perfectly completely instantly and for no cost**. Bitcoin dramatically increases efficiency in banking and will inevitably become the standard medium of storing money/value.**Food for thought** Customers will often ask for their pay checks to deposited as cash. If we can tell the check is legit or if were familiar with the person(kyc) well deposit it as cash even though the check is from another institution meaning in reality the receiving bank isnt getting anything besides a piece of paper and a promise that the account on the check is good for the funds. Verifying those funds takes a business day or more but meanwhile the funds get poofed into the persons account at the click of a button. Also as many of you know since March 2020 deposit institutions are now required to keep 0% of their total deposit accounts in cash reserves. Zero percent! So thats why when I hear someone say that Bitcoin isnt backed by anything my question is what the hell is a dollar backed by besides dirty green rectangles with some old guys signature?,426,0.94,112,2022-01-29 20:47:02

We want to show the world we contribute to the health and resilience of the grid and we know that all eyes will be on us throughout this first big test of the year continued Brammer.> > That financial incentive is key. Miners are not altruistically opting to do the grid a solid by sometimes powering down some or all of its bitcoin miners to free up electricity for those in need. Instead there are a lot of financial perks baked into its arrangement with the nonprofit organization that operates Texas grid. > > Imagine how much you would have to pay Amazon to say ‘Hey theres too much demand for power. Please power down your data center said bitcoin mining engineer Brandon Arvanaghi who now runs Meow a company that enables corporate treasury participation in crypto markets.> > But it can do that with bitcoin very easily because all you have to do is pay the miners slightly more than what they would have made mining for bitcoin that hour continued Arvanaghi who calls the setup a a win-win.> > If the grid operators pay the miners a penny more than they would have made from mining in any given hour then theyll gladly power down. And from Thiels experience they get curtailment requests less than 3% of the time in the course of a year which he estimates comes to about five to ten hours a month.> > Even bitcoin miners that havent cut a deal with ERCOT sometimes voluntarily power down at times of peak consumption when prices shoot higher.> > The price of power per hour is all over the place routinely going negative.> > Shaun Connell the EVP of power at Lancium tells CNBC that in 2020 the price of energy in West Texas was negative between 10% and 20% of the time. The price dips below zero when supply outpaces demand.> > In 2021 the price of power per hour was negatively priced 9% of the time while 5% of all hours peaked above $100. Extreme tails like the ones shown in the chart below arent a good thing.> > > > Scales> In 2021 had miners voluntarily cut back their uptime expectation from 100% to 95% they would have slashed their per megawatt hour price from $178 to $25 according to data from Lancium a Houston-based energy tech company that specializes in bitcoin mining. > > Strategically timed energy curtailment proves especially vital for the Texas grid which exists as its own little island. > > Unlike the rest of the continental U.S. that belongs to either the Eastern or Western interconnection (the names of the two interconnected power grids linking states) 90% of Texas runs on ERCOT a deregulated and independent network of energy providers that is not tethered to any other grid in the U.S. > > While this competitive market often drives down the price of power as providers compete on cost to capture customers it also means that there is less of a safety net baked into the grid. This presents problems in the face of calamitous events such as a power shortage or a natural disaster like the fatal winter storm in early 2021. > > Adding a controllable load resource like bitcoin miners to the grid acts as a sort of life insurance policy. Its almost like a hedge against disaster.> > And its no skin off the back of bitcoin miners. Bitcoin has no uptime requirement nor is the gear worn down by regularly powering off and on.

Ted Cruz Hertz-Shargel doesnt think that additional demand is a good thing.> > ″The analogy I like to use is that if you start smoking two packs a day and then cut back to one pack on holidays that doesnt make smoking good for your health he says.> > Hertz-Shargel argues that ERCOT should be focused on grid improvements to make it easier to get power from solar and wind farms to big consumption centers and that bitcoin miners arent the right way to deal with demand fluctuations. Instead he argues the intermittency of renewables should be met with demand response from societally-beneficial loads like industrial facilities commercial buildings and residential air conditioners — or energy storage.> > But ERCOT interim CEO Brad Jones thinks bitcoin miners can be helpful.> > Jones has been touring the state and hosting public events to answer questions from Texans about the electric grid. Besides winter weather the impact of cryptocurrency mining on the grid is a common question.> > Im pro bitcoin...but Im too risk averse to be an investor in bitcoin Jones told a crowd of residents in Frisco Texas in December. The ERCOT chief went on to explain the mutually beneficial relationship between the grid and bitcoin miners.> > A lot of these solar and wind can produce power down to a negative power range negative $23 per megawatt hour Jones said. These bitcoins see that as a great opportunity. They can get paid to use power. And thats why theyre coming to the state. But thats not necessarily bad.> > Jones makes the point that negative power isnt healthy for the market. Bitcoin miners soak up some of that negative power and when the cost of electricity gets slightly higher than what theyre willing to pay for it (around $100 according to Jones) they shut off.> > So I think its really a valuable potential resource for us.,401,0.93,82,2022-02-05 05:35:54
If you have money in Coinbase take it out..., Im so frustrated and disappointed with Coinbase with what appears to be gross negligence in basic security and customer service.I opened an account in December and within a week was hacked. The hacker somehow was able to change my phone number for two-factor authentication therefore I am unable to access the account or even freeze or close the account. When calling Coinbase help I cannot reach a human for help. Numerous emails result in automated responses pointing me to self-help pages and FAQs. This is unacceptable! How can Coinbase be a publicly-traded company?I simply want to regain access to my account and have no way to do so. Looking over at ethscan it looks like my account is being used for incoming and outgoing transactions without my consent.If Coinbase wants to be a leader in Crypto then it needs to demonstrate solid customer support. Right now there is less than zero support. Its dangerous and too risky to use.,401,0.66,397,2022-01-16 14:38:52
Too many people in this sub who still dont get it,Bitcoin wasnt made to be another Wall Street instrument or an investment if you will. It was always about making sound money with predictable and fair rules. You dont make money with Bitcoin because it is money.Just like gold first people have to believe its a store of value then a layer on top of it will be for transactions. There are basically two outcomes for that vision1. It succeeds and Bitcoin becomes the global money system 2. It fails and goes to zero after successive governments bans and mainstream fudYou measure which one is more likely by things like the network value hash rate adoption etc.Whether it is $44k or $38k or $75k is completely irrelevant. Just like whether Bitcoin was $100 or $400 few years ago is irrelevant today.If you dont believe in #1 and want some exposure just in case just put 1% of your net worth in there and forget it. If you fully believe in #1 DCA and Hodl. If you want to trade in and out Bitcoin is terrible for that. At a minimum you will be paying trading fees and terrible spread. Just open a brokerage account and trade some stock that you feel good about.,399,0.84,324,2022-01-21 19:43:37

Buying Bitcoin every month for 53 months now (since Oct 2017) - update,Been buying Bitcoin every month since late 2017. Nearly always with the same amount few exceptions when I got a bonus from work etc. Basically I wanted to go all-in but didnt have any savings so decided to buy with max amount that I can every month from the salary. I kinda had the idea of stacking my way to a million dollars (or euros) however long it would take. Because the way I see Bitcoin I have no doubt its gonna happen. Sooner if I stack more and later if stack less.I saw stacking sats become a meme and people posting screenshots on Twitter. But I felt like the bigger picture was missing. How much can you achieve by simply stacking sats all the time? This is my idea of a blueprint. I stack with certain amount and have been doing it for a certain while. You can take a look at the progress and get and idea how it would work for you.In short its gonna take time. And its gonna require patience and nerves. Bitcoin is gonna test you and theres no shortcuts to success. My advice start stacking keep stacking! Promise yourself to stack at least 4 years before you even think about giving up. I document my journey here in the blog. Enjoy reading and I hope you have great success stacking sats![https//er-bybitcoin.com/stacking-em-volume-19-ferbuary-2022/](https//er-bybitcoin.com/stacking-em-volume-19-ferbuary-2022/),350,0.98,112,2022-02-05 11:24:02

Why the Lightning Network is the most important thing in Bitcoin right now.,Here are five reasons for the title´s claim ordered from most the significant to the least.**1.** **Increases decentralization**To run a Lightning Node you have to also be running a fully synced Bitcoin Core node. This simple technical requirement means that the number of full Bitcoin nodes is going to explode. Bitcoin  nodes are the most important part of the network since they enforce the consensus rules. Therefore the more nodes the better level of the decentralization and the more immune the Bitcoin Network will be to consensus rules change as we saw during the Blocksize war. For example if someone wanted to change our beloved 21 million fixed supply they would have to convince a substantial majority of people. The more nodes and the more spread out they are across the globe the more impossible this tasks becomes.However Ive always felt that the incentives for an individual running a Bitcoin Node were never that strong. It was always sold as *having full sovereignty over your transactions by not needing to be trust any third party*. But this is only going to convince a small group of people. A second argument that does have a bit more reach is the altruistic argument *you should run a bitcoin node to help out the network*. Many hardcore bitcoiners probably run their nodes for this reason but it is not a sustainable value proposition for the long term and won´t allow us to reach the insanely high level of decentralization mandated by a global trustless currency.I believe the incentives for running a Lightning Node which implies running a Bitcoin Node under the hood are far far stronger. First of all if you are an individual or medium to large business that is going to be making and/or receiving a lot of transactions you can use your own lightning node to make sure youll always be playing lowest possible fees. As a merchant with your own node you can make sure your customers will pay the minimum fees for buying one of your products or if you are paying suppliers you can ensure that your node will search for the shortest route and minimize your fees paid. You can of course use a free custodial third party that avoids the hassle of installing your own lightning node but you will end up paying higher fees over the long run thats how they make their money of course. So a very simple and selfish incentive emerges people will run lightning nodes so that they can save money. A time tried incentive that is pretty effective.But an even stronger incentive than saving money is making money. Many people already run what are called routing nodes with the only purpose of routing payments and taking a small fee every time. This is in fact the main reason why people are interested in running a Lightning node in order to generate a small secondary income stream.Finally the third selfish incentive is that for some sad nerdy people like myself running a node actually is fun! There is a growing group of hobbyists that enjoy maintaining their nodes and participating in the network as a whole just check out [PlebNet ](https//plebnet.wiki/wiki/Welcome_to_Plebnet)for proof of this. Unlike running a simple Bitcoin node where you simply get it up and running and then just watch it sit there running a Lightning Network involves active maintanance by rebalancing channels or figuring which nodes to connect to. This community involvement effect has definitely been a driver for adoption.These three incentives are much stronger than anything preceding them and it simply means that many more people will want to run a Lightning note and therefore as a by-product they will also be running a Bitcoin node whether they want to or not and whether they even know it or not. The end result is a far more decentralized network which will take Bitcoin´s most valuable attribute decentralization to a whole new level.&#x200B;**2. Solves the privacy tradeoff**The criticism that both Edward Snowden and Eric Weinstein have made of Bitcoin which is for me the only reasonable criticism of the protocol I have heard is its lack of privacy on the base layer. The issue is that there needs to be a public record for every transaction as a by-product of having a decentralized blockchain. Buying Bitcoin without KYC is becoming increasingly a legal grey area and the ability for people to track transactions threatens one of Bitcoins most important features ***fungibility***. If certain coins have a shady history they might be worth less while freshly mined coins can be sold at a premium. This is not good.But the Lightning Network comes to the rescue.  When you open a Lightning channel you are sending funds to a 2 of 2 multisig address and from there they do not move **ever** until the channel is closed. With taproot now deployed we will be able to able to hide that its a a multisig so therefore hide that´s its problably a channel opening transaction. Lightning should be integrating this in the next few years You transact on the Lightning network by exchanging and updating IOUs with your channel peer as many times as required. This is 100% private these transactions are fully within your custody and nobody can ever know how or what you spent your money on. Even nodes re-routing payments cannot know the sender and the receiver.The Lightning Network does not increase the privacy of payment it makes payments **100% private**. **Absolutely and unequivocally private**. End of.This is an insane innovation when you think about it not only are payments still permissionless and uncensorable they are now also uncompromisingly private no longer suffering from the trade-off of having to transact on a public ledger like the base Bitcoin layer does.And my favourite part of this is that when you take your funds back onto the Bitcoin network their traceability have also almost been entirely eliminated. Imagine that you buy 1m Satoshis from a fully KYC´ed exchange and then move your Sats from the exchange to your wallet and then from there you open a Lightning channel with a well-connected node in order to spend your Bitcoin. Lets say you go on a bit of a shopping spree and you end up spending around 800K Satoshis. You decide that it would be wiser to save your remaining 200000 sats by sending to your cold storage so you close your Lightning channel which means you move that amount from the multisig address to your cold wallet address. If you use a fresh address (which wallets will almost always generate automatically even if you are sending back to the same wallet) then there is absolutely no way on-chain analysis can know which UXTO is yours and which belongs to the other channel peer. They will see two transactions on the Blockchain with no idea which belongs to who. And funnily enough if you spent the entire amount you put in to channel when closing it there would only be one transaction on the blockchain and again nobody will know if those Sats are going back to you in or to the other owner of the node  and so nobody knows if you spent the entirety o none of your coins. ***What in essence you have done is an ad hoc CoinJoin which severs the relationship between your KYC account and your Bitcoin***. (As along as you do not use the same address as you opened the channel with it goes without saying).Even if the chain analysis makes the assumption that you spent all your Bitcoinit is impossible for them to know what you spent it on and where those Satoshis now are.Privacy solved.&#x200B;&#x200B;**3.  Makes every altcoin irrelevant**One way of understanding s*** coins  is to think of them as being a counterfeit copy of the Bitcoin protocole and token pretending to offer a better or more specialized version of it when in reality they only dillute the value of Bitcoin´s market cap and serve as a very pesky distraction for many newcomers. This is an unfortunate consequence of Bitcoin´s open source nature and the threat posed by s*** coins in the short to medium term is far larger than what many think.However the traction already garnered by the Lightning network and its capabilities really do put the shame all other coins that supposedly are solving Bitcoins scalability limitations. Many s*** coins sacrifice decentralization for more transactional efficiency. Meanwhile the Lightning network achieves the highest speed of transaction at a ridiculously low costs without sacrificing in any shape or form the decentralized and secure properties of the underlying Bitcoin network. This makes other sh**coins completely irrelevant. And the number of users between both is an undeniable proof of this. **Millions** of people use the Lightning network to make transactions **everyday**. **And when I say millions I am not exaggerating**. No other s*** coin even comes close to this number.Another subset of sh** coins claim to use blockchain technologies for non-monetary use cases such as messaging or logistics or art. The whole Web 3.0 blurb. However every single one of these ideas can be built far more easily on the Lightning network and they already are. They are known as LAPPS. These are considered as layer 3 solutions and tackle specific problems. Of course many of these will fail just like in any free market but at least they won´t be stealing peoples money when doing so since investing in these solutions will go through the traditional private market. There is no publicly available token for people to be swindled into buying.Sphinx and Zion are a great example of this. Again Im not saying that these are going to be successful but they are proof that we do not need to be creating completely new chains and pouring capital into them in order to try use cases that by definition are aimed at a small niche of users. I really hope the Lightning Network exposes the Altcoin ecosystem for the inefficient capital draining and overhyped speculation that it really is. Smart entrepreneurs will soon understand that it is far cheaper and efficient to build and fail and iterate on the Lightning network. And in the long term only smart entrepreneurs win.&#x200B;&#x200B;**4. Offers a Proof-of-Stake Alternative**This rarely gets mentioned but its simple enough to understand. Imagine you could lock up your Bitcoin and get rewarded on a percentage basis for processing transactions. Sounds very much like proof of stake right?Well the Lightning network offers you that option. Nodes can charge a small transaction fee for routing payments between unconnected nodes. This means you get a small financial reward for providing the liquidity the network needs. This offers pretty clear competition to what Ethereum is trying so hard and yet failing so far to implement. And unlike Ethereum the Lightning´s network equivalent of staking is available today.Imagine you were a large whale and you wanted to earn a predictable yield on your Bitcoin **while retaining custody** (this last bit is key). The Lightning Network unlike anything else in the ecosystem would allow you to do this. Right now the fees a node can obtain for routing are very low but this is because for now supply outstrips demand but if the Lightning Network´s adoption continues at the rate its at then this will soon change.I can envision a near future where there are staking pools which groups together peoples liquidity to create a very well-connected routing node and collect fees redistributing them out to their clients after taking a small commission for managing the node.&#x200B;&#x200B;**5. Makes price volatility irrelevant.**Bitcoins critics cite volatility as an unsurmountable problem which means it will never become a viable currency  when in fact its volatility is just a temporary feature caused by its insanely fast monetization.But anyway I understand the frustration of making an on-chain transaction and having to wait 6 confirmations (roughly 1 hour) during which Bitcoin´s fiat price could have drastically shifted. This is not great for international transactions or any circumstance where you are using Bitcoin as a bridge between two fiat currencies. (Far better than anything the legacy financial system can offer mind you).Again problem solved with the Lightning Network the instantaneous nature of its transactions mean that you convert instantly in fiat locking in your agreed price. Strike and [OpenNode](https//www.opennode.com/) have shown that this is a key advantage of using the Lightning Network around which they are building their business models.**How you can help**So to close out if this little post has got you more curious about the Lightning network here are a few things you can do to help out.* **Run your own node** (it´s fun I promise)* Show friends families local business how the Lightning Network works **and give them a demonstration**. Most people are genuinely impressed by its speed and low transaction cost when they see it with their own eyes.* Contribute to open source code or **create services for the growing community of node runners**. There is so much still to build.* **Reimagine how existing services could be improved when powered by the Lightning Network**.

Im from El Salvador...UPDATE 6,**Hi its been a while.**Since my last post I had almost no time to reply or prepare new material for Reddit. I owe you the info about buying property and how to be safe here in El Salvador.This time had been a complete rollercoaster for me since my family and co-workers family got covid so the amount of work I had to do by myself increase many folds.Fortunately nothing bad happened and everyone I know had almost recovered. Right now most of the people in my country have flu…cough…omicron variant….Anyways lets talk about Bitcoin.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Overall there havent been any major events the hype about BTC has decreased and as I have said many times nothing has really changed.* There hasnt been any type of crypto education aside from how to use chivo wallet.&#x200B;* Chivo wallet still has some issues remember the identity fraud in previous posts? Many chivo wallet accounts were suspended not sure what variable they (chivo company) use to mark an account as identity fraud but many people were mad because their chivo wallet was suspended…including my father…My father doesnt really care about BTC but wanted to give it a try I downloaded chivo app and taught him how to use it he had like $80. One day he told me he couldnt access the wallet and thats where I found his account was suspended. I called customer support and told me that my father has to personally go to a chivo point (the stand where the atm is located) and get assistance from one of the people there.We arrived at the chivo point told the story to a lady there and start the verification process she took photos and videos of my father face and his ID fill some papers and we were told to wait 30 days…that was in December…up to this day my father account is still suspended I did call again to customer service but they just told me to wait technicians have a lot of work to do since there are many cases like this.  Whether my father gets his money back or not he wont be using BTC again…I know what you are thinking why did you use a non-custodial wallet like chivo and not any other wallet?Thats what my father wanted to use period.I even told him once…thats not your money….&#x200B;* There is another type of fraud that has been seen since last year they continue to open chivo wallet accounts using other peoples documents (identity fraud from previous posts) and somehow link them to the persons bank accounts.Remember that the chivo wallet allows you to send and receive money from a bank account.In this way they steal money from peoples bank accounts without leaving a trace (since no one has been caught).-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------At the moment due to inflation many products have risen in price.* I would suppose that due to the variations in the price of BTC the only thing you hear on social media right now is buy the dip. The BTC against inflation is not used now compared to a couple of months ago.* On the other hand in 2021 remittances increased by 26% compared to 2020 you can read the [official article of the central bank here](https//www.bcr.gob.sv/2022/01/21/el-salvador-recibio-us7517-1-millones-en-remesas-familiares-durante-2021/). (Copy and use google translator) It should be clarified that it does not specify the transactions made through the chivo wallet.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I think thats all for the time being aside from people like my father whose account is suspended and a few others whose money has been stolen…everything is fine.&#x200B;As always Ill try to answer your questions.,252,0.94,83,2022-01-25 02:42:48

Bitcoin seems to be a really impressive technology and as far as I can tell is not going anywhere. I first heard about it back in like 2010 when I was 13. Im now nearly 25 and every time I saw it get mainstream attention I said I wish I had bought some Bitcoin five years ago. Well now I have. It might not be a lot but its something.

To those of you kicking yourselves for buying bitcoin at $40/$50/$60k,Its so easy now to look back at your investments over the last few months and think ‘if youd have waited or done things differently youd be financially in a better position but exposure is the most important thing if you hadnt invested back then and bitcoin went on to be $100k now youd be just as if not more annoyed at yourself! Its all part of the journey so continue to DCA if the price continues to go down lowering your average buy price and before you know it youll be buying more again as we are going back up and through the $40/$50/$60k levels.

Bitcoin helped me quit smoking cigarettes.,Bitcoin helped me quit smoking cigarettes. So for a year now I would DCA into buying Bitcoin instead of buying cigarettes. A pack cost $9 where I am at and I usual smoked that pack in two days. So I started buying BTC every other day instead of smokes. Got the idea from an older coworker who would put away $5 a day instead of buying smokes and buy himself something nice at the end of the year usually a Rolex or some type of wrist watch. Well in the end I ended up with 0.0434 BTC in a year and a lot in fees lol but it was worth it. Hopefully someone whos been on the fence about quitting smoking reads this and gets the encouragement/ motivation to quit! You can do it!,225,0.92,84,2022-01-14 08:18:07

Ticketmaster watch out. NFT tickets are about to disrupt the ticketing industry. A comprehensive list of people who have advcated the benefits of NFT ticketing From Mark Cuban to Vitalik, **Benefits of NFT tickets include**&#x200B;* **Preventing scams and fake tickets** The blockchain provides a single source of truth for both organisers and ticket holders. The transfer of NFTs from initial sale to any subsequent resale is recorded immutably on the blockchain so all parties involved can easily verify the authenticity of the ticket. Even cooler in cases where resale of tickets is strictly forbidden NFTs can be programmed as non-transferrable so they physically cannot be moved to another buyer.* **Perpetual revenue** As programmable digital assets NFTs can have built-in rules for resales merchandise content and royalty splits. This means that the organiser can determine profit sharing percentages for any future resales or downstream creative content on secondary markets and reliably receive these funds knowing they are unalterable within the NFTs coding.* **New revenue opportunities** NFTs put tickets into the realm of programmable money opening up unlimited potential for new revenue opportunities. For example resale of NFT tickets as **collectables** using NFT tickets as a gateway for giving food and drink deals even rewarding super fans who have collected a certain number of event tickets.Over the past year the NFT tickets have gained more attention in the crypto space. I have compiled extensive list of developers investors financial instintutions ticketing companies and NBA owners that have advocated the benefits of NFT ticketing **Mark Cuban – Entrepreneur shark and owner of the Dallas Mavericks** &#x200B;https//preview.redd.it/mxtowrn4r7g81.png?width=632&format=png&auto=webp&s=b136df5f401c2b96e18ec2f730ed8be90dea1f01 **Gary Vaynerchuk - CEO of** **Vaynermedia**** Creator of veefriends** &#x200B;https//preview.redd.it/racoxoa7r7g81.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ee1e8dacce4aa177bbd5e6acc8d28655a9b0324 **Jack Groetzinger – CEO Seatgeek** &#x200B;https//preview.redd.it/r6mrqrz9r7g81.png?width=359&format=png&auto=webp&s=543bcc908a9595bb1ef6b0b6833bbc6dc9e39c83 **Ted Leonsis – owner of NBAs Wizards the NHLs Capitals the WNBAs Washington Mystics** &#x200B;https//preview.redd.it/nqdc3s0dr7g81.png?width=944&format=png&auto=webp&s=46fdacbdeac0f0fdadf1d7bd6830464e947398e2 **Barry Ritholtz – co-founder of Ritholtz wealth mangement – 2 billions usd under management**&#x200B;https//preview.redd.it/1uni3sggr7g81.png?width=455&format=png&auto=webp&s=58315aa34030c765c62263b73d3f3c42e46bb86a **Coinmarketcap** &#x200B;https//preview.redd.it/xf645lvjr7g81.png?width=474&format=png&auto=webp&s=9302749976153bc70298effdbf755c363ee2afaa **Bankless** - Carly Reilly&#x200B;https//preview.redd.it/echesa5nr7g81.png?width=368&format=png&auto=webp&s=c76733e2e6cbf65ff0111c1169b11684092f364f **Grayscale - Worlds largest crypto asset manager** &#x200B;https//preview.redd.it/cm2bja5sr7g81.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=6bb50d036090b6c5a289655e11ddf6e1ea76758e**Snoop Dogg**&#x200B;https//preview.redd.it/rmk8d86xt7g81.png?width=316&format=png&auto=webp&s=56140160d688037f9c2628ee1b8e116ed059f09f&#x200B; **Vitalik Buterin - co-founder Ethereum** &#x200B;https//preview.redd.it/4wp0jpcvr7g81.png?width=345&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebbf9385fc7040321fd62d505f9cd75261b30675,353,0.9,99,2022-02-06 13:35:21

Just a reminder to hold any stablecoin other than USDT.,Aside from the fact that its actually way safer for you replacing USDT for other stablecoins will decrease the market cap of Tether and thus make its grips on the market looser and looser.There are so many other stablecoins that are legitimately backed by a 11 ratio like USDC EURST BUSD and my favorite USDT.If anything were slowly starting to see USDT lose dominance in the market and growth is starting to decrease.These are all good signs.

How can the SEC say that top cryptos are too volatile and we need protections when growth stocks are plummeting at record rates?,[TL;DR](https//youtu.be/NzvWSlv3SM8)  This isnt volatile at all right?Facebook also just had a 26% drop in less than a dayGenslers argument against a BTC ETF is that*Its a digital scarce store of value but highly volatile Gensler said talking about bitcoin specifically. And theres investors that want to trade that and trade that for its volatility in some cases just because it is lower correlation with other markets. I think that we need greater investor protection there.**Gensler later added that he believes bitcoin is a speculative store of value and that the SEC should be technology neutral when it comes to innovations in markets.*One of my absolute favorite quotes from Ryan Selkis;**Im sick of feeling like we have to apologize for our early stage and walk on egg shells around politicians and regulators.****We built a $2 trillion financial market from scratch in less than a decade with absolutely no institutional help and active encumbrances from government.****Meanwhile banks give you 0.025% interest on your deposits and front run your trades legally and DC grifters overspend & debase your tax dollars while they insider trade stocks with impunity.****Like other early stage transformational tech markets there are some characters some bad actors. But mostly its just brave entrepreneurs and innovators.****Dont spit in our face and pretend youre here to save people from us.****We started this movement to save people from you.**,161,0.9,128,2022-02-06 07:23:33

Can anyone verify if they are legit? Any users out there tell me about their experience? I know some platforms are not kind to their users.

Honestly some celebrities are genuine and use the money generated from NFT sales to push for positive projects like donations and such but those lie in the shadow of the money chasers. I honestly would advise these honest genuine celebrities to use a genuine platform built for this. That way they can approach their target audience in the right manner without making noise everywhere. And I mean NFT platforms like Yunometa trying to set categories and draw lines in the sand separating the markets and making a spring cleanup. Change is coming we just got to push for it for all of our sake. ,65,0.91,22,2022-02-04 00:31:49

Ethereum is the superior coin prove me wrong.,Lately I have been on a major ETH kick throwing huge amounts on money at the coin convinced it cannot fail. I am hoping one of you have some logical reason and insight that might rebalance my expectations about ETH and bring my frame of thinking back down to earth or if not solidify my current state of mind that ETH is the future of crypto currency and offers more value to the world than BTC or other alt coins. Superiority over alt coins1. ETH being one of the top crypto currencies in the world makes it an easy choice when considering any digital asset; it has proven its legitimacy and built a thick layer of confidence over the years that will be hard to break in to the future.2. Smart contracts look to change the landscape of financial markets or really any area today where money or consensus is exchanged between two parties regardless of application. This one is huge I cannot stress enough how valuable smart contracts are to the future of the world.3. Though other coins have hit the stage offering smart contract functionality and even offering higher throughput when compared to ETH the prospect of consensus layer (ETH 2.0) which claims to offer 100000 transaction per second (Google suggest that Visa can handle 24000 transaction per second?). This enormous increase in transaction processing would put ETH in the number 1 seat for throughput and scalability. Unlocking the endless potential for smart contracts and transactions in general.4. Reliability is a big factor for me despite some of these really interesting new coins that offer a comparable network all seems to have a struggle adjusting to their popularity and in a pretty bad way. ETH though not susceptible to similar experiences has already had its share of discovery and has perhaps matured to a more reliable and dependable network.5. The ETH development team is perhaps one of the most respected and trusted block chain development teams in the world. Over the years this team has garnered a huge amount of respect in the crypto community. This makes me feel that I am in pretty good hands and that is worth something.Superiority over BTC Despite BTC being the big dog on the block and accepted by most as the gold standard of crypto I see many reasons why ETH is a far better option.6. True Value - BTC fights a lot of battles in regards to its true value many will argue that BTC has no real value and offers nothing but a collective agreement that it is valuable (I dont agree with this btw) you know like gold or diamonds things we have all agreed are valuable.... However stupid this argument is there is some truth in the logic as gold can still be used in maybe industrial applications resulting in value outside of just backing a currency (which it doesnt even do anymore in some cases). This argument against BTC true value cannot be applied to ETH as in addition to being an asset it also offers utility if we all agree ETH was useless as an asset what we could not deny is the its usefulness as a utility due to smart contract functionality.7. We know who created ETH. Early on and perhaps still today people find comfort in the fact that BTCs creator is anonymous (or dead or maybe not anonymous? who knows?) this seemed pretty cool in 2017 when the world started to find real interest in block chain and decentralization. However I feel as time has passed this has become a hindrance for BTC if the last couple years have taught us anything its that crypto currency needs flexibility to become truly useful and to be applied in any mainstream setting. It is my personal opinion that knowing a dedicated development team backs a product and is pushing to improve it leave me with this a sense that BTC will become the Commodore 64 of the crypto world in the next 10 years with no true direction or guidance. ETH will become the Xbox or PlayStation.8. Out of reach growth potential - Many claim BTC is going to between $100000 and $500000 in the next X number of years; though this may be true normal people cannot acquire enough BTC to allow them to buy that Lambo. ETH however is still only 3k at time of writing this which gives us little guys a fighting chance of getting in early (or sooner). Imagine ETH is realized to its full potential with Defi NFTs governance or any other future application and it can also transact 100k transactions per second. Whats not to say ETH will be worth 40000 or even 100000 in future? In this regard ETH could much more easily double triple quadruple rinse and repeat. currently the total supply is of ETH is in the 120 million range and BTC is 21 million today if you reduced the supply of ETH to match that of BTC each ETH would be 15k still far below the value of where BTC sits this is insane how ETH is currently 3 times less valuable than BTC while offering so much more?!As a software engineer with a solid understanding of crypto block chain and smart contracts it feels impossible for me to accept that ETHs true value has been recognized and I know that its full potential far exceeds thats of BTC or any crypto currency to date. I know with depth how a lot of applications work I think this makes it a bit easier for me to see how ETH could be used is an endless amount of ways to benefit nearly all industries. My go to example is my interpretation of DeFi as a trustless financial Internet thinks of the opportunities this presents to developers businesses entrepreneurs or any of us as individuals. Block chain will allow the collective voice of the world to be heard without a filter and transact with freedom so we can create the world we truly desire.If you made it this far Id love to hear your thoughts as to why any logic I have outlined above is either flat out wrong misunderstood or irrelevant to the success of ETH.,59,0.69,208,2022-02-08 17:14:33

John Deaton Interview about the XRP SEC Lawsuit,Link to interview  [interview](https//youtu.be/3FCe-3L_peA)John Deaton discusses his path from crypto investor to being the face of the XRP SEC lawsuit.  In the interview he covers the best case scenario for the lawsuit and what would need to happen to lead to a settlement and possible time lines.  He also covers the unlikely worst case scenario of the judge finding XRP as a security and what that would mean for Ripple as a company and the potential fallout for the XRP coin.  He believes in this scenario a decision could come sometime in July or August.  In this scenario XRP may only be sold to accredited investors and be removed from all exchanges permanently.  They also discuss how this could lead to an XRP buyback and what that would mean for the XRPLedger.They also cover China banning crypto and trying to implement their own CBDC as well as the news of potential Russian regulation of crypto and crypto mining.  How US politicians may respond in the coming weeks including the upcoming executive order.  Scams securities and transparency in the crypto space are also covered and how the decision can impact the entire crypto space going forward.TLDR  Two military vets discuss corrupt SEC and cryptocurrency.,56,0.89,71,2022-01-29 06:09:55

Best Upcoming Metaverse Projects (That arent Facebook!), Heres a list of some of the most promising Metaverse projects out there. Some you may be familiar with while others may be newer projects that are currently flying under the radar... Id love to hear about any other hotly tipped projects that people are excited about. Obviously none of this is financial advice; rather it is a reflection on some ongoing and upcoming projects that have been gaining traction.1.	2.26 billion mcap Decentraland (MANA) - Binance - Coinbase - Huobi Obviously most of you are already aware of this. The most well-known blockchain-based virtual reality world has been rallying as a result of recent attention and appears to be on track to surpass its previous high. The Ethereum Blockchain powers Decentraland a community-driven Metaverse. Users can use its Builder Tool or SDK (developer toolkit) which are designed to create virtual environments and applications to create experience and monetize content.2.	Bloktopia (BLOK) - -Constructed with Polygon. There were some early doubts about its legitimacy but with names like Elrond and Avax establishing virtual headquarters in this metaverse they are already attracting a large number of reputable names to the project. Earn cryptocurrency by participating in games and daily competitions as well as using the builder tools to create your own areas. This one is looking to challenge the likes of Sandbox and Decentraland as the next place to hang out in the VR world with all the usual metaverse goodness. Keep in mind that the game hasnt been released yet!3.	Metakawn They want to create the first Halal Metaverse for Generation M where everyone shares the same values. They also want to bridge the gap between Muslim* creatives/content creators and their fans (in fields such as fashion sports health religion education art and design music family etc.). A platform that allows Muslim creators to be paid fairly and directly by their community rather than relying on brand sponsorship and/or social media platforms (Youtube etc.).,44,0.98,16,2022-02-04 01:30:55

Intel creating better mining mechanisms is good news for us all,Its good news for the small projects and the large ones alike. It means more and more companies will invest in making mining and crypto more accessible and faster. Hashrates go up activity increases and the market expands. Ive heard from many people the slow transaction speed is what keeps them away from BTC and that large transaction fees keep them away from ETH. Well the future shows glimmers of improvement now that mining is getting better and more adequately researched the market is bound to expand. This means that small projects out there like Royal Falcons Club will be viewed by more people and larger projects like the Ethereum giant will become easier for all. ,44,0.95,31,2022-01-20 10:10:28

Mainstream Adoption of Stablecoins is Inevitable,In times of volatility we know stablecoins are always hedge against the adverse effect of the unstable market and in the crypto space adoption has only continue to grow in several protocols/ecosystems launching their respective USD-Pegged digital assets.As seen in the recent release from the FED [Powell](https//www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/01/11/live-blog-fed-chair-jerome-powell-appears-before-the-senate-banking-committee/) says; Private stablecoins can co-exist with the digital Dollar. In my opinion its a welcome development not just for private stablecoins but for all.One of the most adopted stablecoins I think other than Tether & USDC is TerraUSD Its recent partnership with Near Protocol brings UST to NEAR & AURORA platform.Avalanche also attracted a [DeFi adoption boost](https//medium.com/avalancheavax/circle-launches-usdc-on-avalanche-to-accelerate-defi-adoption-6eddd00e45b5). As Circle; a global internet finance firm that provides internet-based payments and financial infrastructure to businesses of all sizes announced native support for USD Coin (USDC) on its network.Stablecoins minting platform like Oin Finance is also making a big move in the DeFi space. The launch of its [OINDAO V3](https//near.oin.finance/Vault/) on NEAR gained a massive TVL boost as users can mint brand-labelled stable assets using native assets of the underlying chain as collateral. In its plan it will extend to other chains like Harmony Avalanche Polygon etcIt can only continue to get better in 2022 I expect to see more native cross-chain integration of stablecoins across several scalable chains this will foster adoption & their applications in real life.Do you agree that the FED news is bullish for stablecoins & their respective protocols?

You can also create your own pool of bets and have others throw money in and profit that way.I made $10~ on the litecoin one and like $50 on various other ones.

Layer 2 Ethereum Scaling Solution — Nahmii,As **Ethereum** continues to gain more popularity the need to scale up to handle more transactions give birth to several Ethereum scaling solutions including Layer 2 roll-ups & Side-chains. All scaling solutions are created to meet up the goals of transaction speed and transaction throughput allowing the platform to process thousands of transactions per second and scale globally.However Layer 2 platforms use the Ethereum main-net security directly from the Layer 1 *Ethereum* consensus unlike the Sidechains that run parallel to the Ethereum main-net. The Layer 2 platforms like *Optimism ZK roll-ups Arbitrum Nahmii* etc provide solutions with Ethereum scaling issues and development of more L2s to ensure Ethereum continues to be the most continually used smart contract platform as more organizations/institutions begin to understand the benefits and abilities smart contracts. *Optimism* is Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible but takes a longer time for transactions to be confirmed unlike ZK roll-ups that are not EVM compatible but faster transaction throughput. For the Optimistic security protocols to be enacted on *Arbitrum* 7-days wait time for main-net confirmation is needed. Thereafter i found *Nahmii* to be the most prominent model employed to scale *Ethereum.* **Nahmii** is a revolutionary layer 2 scaling protocol for the Ethereum blockchain which provides faster throughput low latency instant finality and predictable fees that are unmatched by other scaling solutions. Nahmii is EVM compatible and addresses challenges by leveraging Ethereums security providing a high-speed and low-cost execution layer. It makes every Ethereum dApp better and production-ready with* **High Throughput*** **Low Latency*** **Instant Finality*** **Predictable Fees*** **Low Transaction Fees** **Nahmii** bridge is one of the exciting features within the Nahmii ecosystem making it stand out from the competition. The Nahmii Bridge works through the meta-mask extension and serves as a portal in and out of the Nahmii network. It also allows deposit and withdrawal of ERC-20 tokens like **NII.**Once a bridge of assets from Ethereum to Nahmii is complete the asset balance is displayed within a short time.  These amazing features generally make Nahmii one of the fastest-growing Scaling solutions on the Ethereum network.**Learn more about the Nahmii bridge here** [***https//blog.nahmii.io/the-nahmii-bridge-is-now-live-e245bcfe6d66***](https//blog.nahmii.io/the-nahmii-bridge-is-now-live-e245bcfe6d66)&#x200B;Feel free to share your thoughts about other Ethereum scaling solutions including layer 2 platforms and side-chains.,36,0.95,69,2022-01-22 17:28:56

Cryptocurrency and fiat money are not rivals. Both of them are essential to the economy now and both of will remain for many years to come.,I mean people are still trying to put crypto and fiat in a battle. Like one is going to delete the other. That was never the case. Yeah crypto is the newer one here but that doesnt mean that its here to give any challenge to fiat money and vice versa.I think that these assets will be used each in its way. But crypto is still relatively young comparing to the old fiat currencies which means we will be seeing a lot of additions in terms of usage and utility and were already seeing companies accepting crypto payments like Elon Musks Tesla. And also crypto platforms are also allowing their users to pay using their digital tokens like of Binance Coinbase or CoinOvy for example. I think comparing these two genres of assets is literally a waste of time. I mean yeah its normal to hype crypto these days since its simply still new and has a huge room for growth but fiat is not going anywhere anytime soon. Both of them will be around for good.,31,0.84,35,2022-01-25 15:22:22

Cryptocurrency isnt here to replace fiat. I mean these two genres can coexist and thats how its going to be.,I mean its totally illogical to say that cryptocurrency is going to be replacing fiat money in the next few years. Thats not how its supposed to go. I mean these two asset classes can coexist and each serve in its way.The potential of crypto is surely huge and well be seeing a lot of growth in this market. But if you think that crypto is here to take away the existence of fiat money youre totally wrong. I mean the use of crypto is surely going to evolve and we will be seeing a lot of payments accepted in crypto and platforms like CoinOvy and Binance are already allowing to shop and pay with their coins and tokens. Bottom line crypto and fiat will coexist and the use cases of crypto will be increasing and giving it huge push in terms of value but its main target isnt to replace fiat at all.,32,0.77,48,2022-01-11 11:20:45

The most realistic way to avoid crypto projects Scams.,Statistics show that over $80 million dollars have been lost to crypto scams in the United States alone. This is had made investments in crypto projects quite scary and invariably drastically reduced investor confidence and trust.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               At last there is some good news in this respect. The crypto ecosystem is becoming safer with the intervention of platforms like the RiseUp V2 platform. As their name implies they have indeed risen up to the task of making the crypto industry a safer space for investors providing users with a way to screen smart contracts and wallets on the most widely used blockchains including Ethereum Binance Smart Chain and Polygon.These platforms are gradually bringing back investor trust and confidence to the crypto industry through the eradication of scams. ,30,0.96,15,2022-02-06 14:34:24

How will crypto and blockchain tools become a part of our everyday lives? ,Weve seen how Twitter introduced a feature that allows you to use your nft image as your profile picture. This feature is only available to Twitter blue users and the nft image chosen will be hexagonal in shape.Similarly reddit and discord are following in Twitters footsteps. Now Elon Musk has publicly stated his opinion on the subject on Twitter but I believe it is beneficial to adoption.As the technology becomes more widely adopted everyone from celebrities to corporations is experimenting with it. While many people are unsure what to look for I have a few ideas.	As the market for AI-generated NFTs becomes saturated new projects have emerged that are unique in that they allow you to create your own NFt avatar rather than relying on a fixed image. You may occasionally be unable to customise your avatar after purchasing a nft. You have to put what youve bought. However some major projects such as the Nft avatar maker are now available.The Avatar Tool that does it all is NFT Avatar Maker. Users will be able to create their Avatars from a growing list of assets with billions of possible combinations and over 1200 assets available at launch.Similar to how we use extensions in our browsers tools like these will become commonplace as seen with metamask.,28,0.69,6,2022-02-05 10:34:18

Is it still cheap to fund blockchain development?,It seems that today the market dawned with a strong upward rebound fee rates are increasing market capitalization is increasing and the value of the rest of the cryptocurrencies is increasing.This means the obvious therefore all cryptocurrencies go up and it becomes more expensive to buy.Does this mean that momentarily startups for blockchain development will have to have more capital?Truth be told there will be protocols where more will be needed and probably others where it will remain the same.I guess development funding will be almost unaffected if they invest in DECENTRALIZED development protocols such as the DIG protocol.

I mean if we can get to make cryptocurrency easier to cash out or to have more purchasing power in terms of companies approving crypto payments.Right now were seeing platforms that are trying to improve the use case of cryptocurrencies allowing users to make direct payments with their crypto assets platforms lie Binance Coinbase or Coinovy.I think that for cryptocurrency adoption to take place we neet to see more of these platforms.

Urgent SEC has proposed a new Amendment where it seeks to classify even DEX as ATS (alternative trading system for securities). This could be a big barrier for DeFi as we know it as no DEX can comply with these regulations. Hester Pierce is dissenting to it.,The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has just issued a hastily drafted Amendment that aims to include non-exchanges and even communication services in the definition of ATS (alternate trading system for securities). They are attempting to usurp and broaden their mission from licensed exchanges to other platforms that do not meet the standards of regulated securities exchanges by this modification.According to SEC Chair Gensler this legislation [cover platforms](https//youtu.be/NzvWSlv3SM8) of all kindsTheyve only given you 30 days to respond if you have anything to say about it. These amendments will likely be used by the SEC to pursue DeFi methods. Trading-Interest-Based Regime is the new definition of exchanges which includes everything from AMM DEX to liquidity pool trading protocols such the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).Because of the DEX protocols lack of centralization it is nearly hard for decentralized AMM and money markets to secure SEC licenses.For the sake of making trades via smart contract calls communication platforms like blockchain explorers could be included in the ATS. An unregistered exchange can be sued by the SEC for operating an unlicensed exchange and this has major ramifications for the entire business. For an AMM developer or a blockchain startup becoming registered as a securities exchange is no small feat; it would require millions of dollars. Theres a good reason why only a few exchanges exist such as the NYSE and Nasdaq.Call to action [https//lexnode.substack.com/p/urgent-considerations-of-impact-on](https//lexnode.substack.com/p/urgent-considerations-of-impact-on) the latest amendments[https//www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2022/349062.pdf](https//www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2022/349062.pdf) was the original draft.Disagreement by SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce [https//www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-ats-20220126](https//www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-ats-20220126),21,0.85,10,2022-02-07 19:09:57

Index investing on the Blockchain,Index investing is a form of investing that uses a passive approach that attempts to generate returns like a broad market index. The approach is essentially a buy-and-hold strategy to replicate the performance of a specific index—usually an equity or fixed-income index—by purchasing the component securities of the index. This passive approach is advantageous because of the lower management fees and expense ratios (ERs) when compared with actively managed funds. Index funds also tend to be more tax-efficient due to few number of trades usually done. Another appealing quality of index investing is that it is an effective method of diversifying against risks.In recent years digital assets have become a very lucrative portfolio for index investing. The meteoric rise of the value of cryptocurrency has been a major driver for this. However there is an issue of inadequate understanding of the crypto space. To solve this problem and make index investing on digital assets a lot easier it is advisable to leverage platforms with the right level of expertise and insight into the world of index investing. Beyond the ease it is also less risky. Several platforms offer good ROI but personally I believe Konstellations VegaX is noteworthy because of its hassle-free user interface and excellent ROI (Over 30%).,21,0.77,7,2022-02-05 15:51:07

The IMFs behavior towards El Salvador only further justifies the very existence and absolute necessity of Bitcoin for the world,El Salvador is a sovereign country that has the full right to choose how it wants to act to build a better future for its people.Nayib Bukele chose Bitcoin to try to change the future of his country. Under the current system El Salvador was condemned to survive by begging for aid from the IMF or the World Bank.Nayib Bukele understood the why of Bitcoin and decided to seize this opportunity to change the future of El Salvador and its people. The people of El Salvador overwhelmingly support Nayib Bukele in what he is trying to do for the country.El Salvadors bold choice has already changed the way the country is seen around the world. Everyone is talking about El Salvador and more and more entrepreneurs will be coming to El Salvador to participate in this experiment of building the first Bitcoin Nation.Who knew where El Salvador was before Nayib Bukele made this choice? Very few people. No one was talking about El Salvador. Bitcoin is already a game-changer for El Salvador and this is clearly just the beginning.While the IMF or the World Bank scoffed at Bitcoin a few years ago now these institutions are getting scared by the growing possibility that the Bitcoin experiment will succeed in El Salvador and motivate other countries to follow Nayib Bukeles path.Tonga is talking about adopting Bitcoin by the end of 2022 as are other countries in South and Central America. In short something is happening and the IMF feels the danger mounting for its obsolete system.Rather than letting the people determine for themselves the IMF is threatening El Salvador saying the country must abandon Bitcoin. The IMFs threats only justify in my opinion the very existence of Bitcoin and the absolute necessity for the world to have this alternative system available.Since El Salvador will logically refuse to obey the IMF whats next? Will America eventually orchestrate a coup in El Salvador to overthrow the government and end the Bitcoin experiment? How far are the powerful people in the current system willing to go to prevent countries from expressing their free will in monetary and financial matters?El Salvador must continue to resist outside pressure and other countries that will opt for the Bitcoin system in 2022 must do the same. The world is changing and the first countries to adopt Bitcoin will be the ones to benefit the most in the future.,20,0.83,56,2022-01-27 17:31:14

Cashback staking differences between card competitors,Hey guysDo you use any crypto payment card? Which one?Ive been looking into the competition and it seems to me there are three main cards in the space – CDC Binance and Plutus.For the CDC card the levels are as follows0 USD – 1%400 USD – 2%4000 USD – 3%40.000 USD – 5%400.000 USD – 8%For Binance the levels are0 BNB – 01%1 BNB – 2%10 BNB – 3%40 BNB – 4%100 BNB – 5%250 BNB – 6%600 BNB – 8%For Plutus the current levels are0 PLU – 3% (250€/£ per month)100 PLU – 3%  400 PLU – 4%Plutus has announced that they will revamp the Rewards model this quarter with new staking levels0 PLU – 3%250 PLU – 4%500 PLU – 5%1000 PLU – 6%2000 PLU – 8%In my opinion the Binance card is lackluster as it doesnt offer perks other than straightforward cashback and the entry level (free) is only for 01%.Between CDC and Plutus though the competition seems fiercer. Although its true CDC includes some nice staking benefits (mainly for the 4000 and 40.000 USD levels) with Spotify Netflix with the launching of Rewards 2.0 by Plutus it seems to me that those benefits will be eclipsed by Plutus perks – when comparing the 250 PLU level with the 4000 USD in CRO you get 4 perks worth c. 10 €/£ and even though you can choose the same Spotify and Netflix you also get your pick among a range of other benefits such as Prime Disney+ Apple Uber Uber Eats Booking AirBnB etc. On the next level for CDC you get the Prime and not much else for Plutus you get another perk of your choice.There seems to me there is also a substantial difference in the current price of getting these benefits/perks and cashback at current price you can get 3% unlimited cashback on Plutus for under 1500 USD and 4% for under 6000 USD.Furthermore Plutus seems to be non-custodial which I feel is much better for the consumers (not your keys not your coins!) and has apparently a lot less MCC exclusions so you can get cashback paying on more merchants.&#x200B;I was wondering which card(s) you use and why?Im inclined to go with Plutus seems to be more bang for buck and they were just listed in Coinbase so I would expect it to keep growing.,21,0.95,47,2022-02-02 19:00:35

I posted this yesterday on the r/Cryptocurrency subreddit and got banned!,Ok.. so yesterday I tried to warn them that we were due for a big push.. I know I can be a bit of a dick the way I speak but really I was just trying to drop some knowledge. So many people been posting nonsense and I get it.. a lot of people are holding bags way beyond what they should be and letting their emotions get the upper hand.  its been a rough year.  Not only did they remove my post.. but they banned me too! It was pretty satisfying to wake up to the charts this morning not going to lie.. I just hope that you didnt panic sell on that dip.. I managed to buy back in around midnight.From now on I will post my hot takes here.Here is the link if you want to watch the bitcoin chart mentioned.

I build this tool - would anyone else find it useful?,HelloSo it took me like 2 months but I finally got it to work.I built a tool which has 3 main features1- Allows you to spot interesting wallets which you can track. You simply put 2 (or more) coins and timespans - and the tool will give you all the wallets that meet these conditions (e.g. bought SAND in September and MANA in August). Along with some other filters (min. value etc.).There are many useful use cases for this.2- Find the Telegram username behind a wallet. It only works to find the user in ~30% of the time but Ive found it to be very useful.3- Alerts (phone/email/Slack/Telegram) for when a specific wallet/coin/buy-orders/sell-orders changes (specific conditions/filters).Im also thinking of adding a tool which tells you if your favorite wallets are buying a specific coin. For example you can Find & Bookmark wallets that are good at Gaming niche (using feature #1). Then get notified when theres any interesting project that many of them are buying into.&#x200B;Im thinking of launching them as a pack (SaaS).Would anyone be interested in joining the Beta testing?,21,0.96,31,2022-01-18 11:10:34

How to earn passive income in Defi,  Defi is such a buzzword these days that almost everyone is using it.Not only retail investors but a growing number of institutional investors are interested in participating as wellThere is no reason to deny that the DeFi space is expanding.With the newly emerging solutions businesses and individuals alike want to capitalize on the benefits of decentralized finance.Decentralized finance has not only increased the potential for global financial inclusion but it has also increased the potential for using and managing digital assets. So what exactly is Defi-Decentralized finance (DeFi) is an umbrella term for a variety of public blockchain applications and projects aimed at disrupting the traditional finance world.DeFi refers to financial applications built on blockchain technologies that are inspired by blockchain technology. So prior to the establishment of Defi we had been using Cefi for lets say thousands of years but the system is getting old.I can still remember how stressed I felt the last time I needed to loan some money from the bank.So yes there was a need for change and yes change is the only constant in the world.Defi introduced new possibilities by eliminating the intermediary found in Cefi and connecting the user directly to the smart contracts. There are several ways to use Defi to your advantage now.Crypto custodian solutions like Unido and Fireblocks assist institutional investors and SMEs in utilizing Defi and crypto allowing them to invest in a seamless manner for maximum profit while also resolving cash flow issues.However we may not be delving into that right nowNow let discuss staking.DeFi staking is the practice of entrusting crypto assets to a smart contract in exchange for becoming a validator in a DeFi protocol or a Layer 1 blockchain and earning rewards for performing the duties required by the role.Thats as straightforward as it gets.However there are several risks associated with Staking that you should be aware of before diving in.**Risks in Staking**The first thing you should know is that the safety of the staked tokens is directly proportional to the safety of the protocol.Slashing volatility risks validator risks and server risks are all possible.Furthermore you may have to deal with issues such as fund loss or theft reward waiting periods project failure liquidity risks minimum holdings and extended lock-up periods.So why should you stake? Staking earns you steady passive income rather than just saving your tokens in a wallet why not stake them to earn more There are some staking pools that will offer you very high APY for passive income but as I always say the higher the apy the higher the risk.Ill be listing some of the platforms Ive previously staked as well as a new platforms Im looking forward tooCrypto.com- You can stake your stables and other altcoins coins on it and the APY is determined by how many CRO you stake with the other token. Celsius is a community of over 1 million users who earn up to a 17% return on their cryptocurrency.You can get new coins every week and borrow money at 1% interest.With no fees you can buy coins earn yield borrow and transfer them.Web and mobile apps are available.IMOThe APY isnt as high as on Crypto.com but its still worthwhile in the long run. https//celsius.network/Kucoin staking- The KuCoin exchange allows users to stake their coins without locking them.This is accomplished through a process known as Soft Staking. UnidoIn-app staking is also on the horizon and Im eager to learn how much APY it will provide. Unido enables enterprises and institutional investors such as hedge funds asset managers and digital banks to manage and invest in DeFi and Crypto markets in a seamless manner.Its a platform that promotes mass crypto adoption and I believe it will be extremely valuable in the future.Its Community beta wait list is now available and I have signed up. https//pac-21249071.hubspotpagebuilder.com/en-au/unidoep-community-beta-testingIts the best time to earn some passive income so leave more projects that allow staking in the comments section so I can go through them as well.,17,0.76,134,2022-02-07 08:24:15
Celebrities are the cringiest people out there,Im serious when I say this and I know Im not the only one who believes this. I cant believe how cringe theyve become even more than they already were before. Matter of fact after their unapologetic entry in the crypto market their cringe has reached astronomical levels.I mean seriously are they even selling these NFTs that they are shilling? I would imagine even if someone was interested in their NFT they would get lost in a sea of angry and rowdy fans in the comment section. This is such a bad idea. I mean why not just use a dedicated platform just for celebrity NFTs? I heard Yunometa was working on making this a thing. Good. That way said celebrities can approach their target demographic appropriately and the celebrity can sell their work. And the target audience would get their fix. Someone should tell them how bad what theyre currently doing for their image and that the replacements presents now could fix it for them and for all of us too. ,16,0.79,24,2022-02-05 06:35:50

PLEASE DONT FEED THE BEARS!,A few years ago I began investing in crypto. I did ok. Made some money and waspretty pleased with my self. Then came my first bear market. I tried to hold out butit just kept dipping. Maybe I dont have the knack for this after all? Maybe I dontbelong swimming on the deep end? So I sold my crypto and fed it all to the bears Ipanic sold. I broke even and felt a little relief. Then when the market rebounded asit always has. My meager 2K that I got back have been 300K. I felt pretty bad.You see I had owned BTC ETH and more. But I was fine. I had a job. Paid my bills.And what crypto I owned was owned and it was mine. What I really owned washope. And when I sold it I owned nothing that had the potential to change my life.Just the day by day grind. Losing it would not have been the end of the world. Butselling was the end of that exhilaration and excitement of what might have been. Ididnt have the metal. You see I owned BTC ETH and more. We all know wherethose went and how it is now. So Now when Once I buy I consider the moneygone. When I do buy crypto now I hold. Im in this until the bitter end. Or aglorious future. I will not feed the bears my hope. So I will keep mv head down andstay silent. I wont give others a reason to bash me when crypto is in the red. Onthe other hand when crypto climbs (as it inevitably always does) when I am askedhow did you do it. I will also remain silent then also. Its a long line that will belittlewhen the bears feed. But it is also a long line asking how did you do this when thebulls run.,17,0.77,43,2022-01-22 19:45:48
Is an alt season possible and which altcoins can surprise us,Today we are witnessing a long downtrend in the crypto market. BTC price approached the key trend level. Indicators will show us that the market is overbought and I think that a market reversal is fully possible. At the same time the BTC dominance on the bottom. And the alt indicator of the season will show its greater probability. What do you think about this is it possible to start the alt season and what altcoins can surprise us? Personally I think that these will be altcoins that showed growth during the downtrend NEAR ATOM FTM LINK,17,0.79,60,2022-01-20 18:48:56

However it is only available in the United States of America. Ive been waiting and waiting and waiting but it is still not available where I live. I live in Asia and I really want to use a nice crypto credit card.The interest you get through a crypto credit card is far better than any regular credit card we used in our daily lives.

I dont think it has much potential left inside of it and people are starting to move over to other coins with low mcaps like ELON which have more potential.So I dont think Tesla is honestly gonna risk so much money for a memecoin thats at the top of its potential right now.,101,0.83,228,2022-01-19 14:42:35

Crashes like this one are the reason you should never underestimate stablecoin staking,I bet the majority of people are severely affected by this crash and I myself am one of them. However theres a small minority that didnt feel anything at all.These are people staking USDC and USDT for 8% to 20% APY on platforms like ALGO Yearn and AGFI.Since stablecoins are well… stable these high APYs dont get affected by market dips and crashed and these people keep on making money while the whole market is losing.Now Im not saying you should go all in on stablecoin staking but consider allocating a small portion of your portfolio towards this. This is exactly what Ill be doing from now on. Itll really protect me in times like these.,94,0.93,185,2022-01-22 19:05:33

Whenever the market crashes the first thing I worry about is Tether…,Tether has been proven time and time again to be severely lacking in back up and only a small amount of USDT is actually collateralized.&#x200B;During bullish times this shouldnt be a problem but when the market goes bearish and people start mass selling thats when I start to worry.&#x200B;Since Tethers USDT is not backed this means it will eventually reach a point where the selling pressure is too much for Tether to handle and as soon as some cracks begin to form and everyones fear starts coming into realization Tether would collapse in a matter if days.&#x200B;This is why I urge everyone to always keep their money in stablecoins like USDC EURST and UST which all legitimately have 11 back up ratios and have all been audited.,61,0.95,183,2022-01-30 20:51:48

How do some people have the guts to stake USDT?,Tether is well known to be one of the crypto markets biggest schemes with them regularly minting stablecoins that arent backed by any collateral.Not very stable of a stablecoin huh.The thing is in the case of Tether crashing you could still cut some losses and convert to different assets if you were fast enough. But with staking youre basically screwed.I dont get people who stake USDT. Like why? There are so many other much safer and audited 11 backed stablecoins like USDC EURST and UST.

The IMFs behavior towards El Salvador only further justifies the very existence and absolute necessity of Bitcoin for the world,El Salvador is a sovereign country that has the full right to choose how it wants to act to build a better future for its people.Nayib Bukele chose Bitcoin to try to change the future of his country. Under the current system El Salvador was condemned to survive by begging for aid from the IMF or the World Bank.Nayib Bukele understood the why of Bitcoin and decided to seize this opportunity to change the future of El Salvador and its people. The people of El Salvador overwhelmingly support Nayib Bukele in what he is trying to do for the country.El Salvadors bold choice has already changed the way the country is seen around the world. Everyone is talking about El Salvador and more and more entrepreneurs will be coming to El Salvador to participate in this experiment of building the first Bitcoin Nation.Who knew where El Salvador was before Nayib Bukele made this choice? Very few people. No one was talking about El Salvador. Bitcoin is already a game-changer for El Salvador and this is clearly just the beginning.While the IMF or the World Bank scoffed at Bitcoin a few years ago now these institutions are getting scared by the growing possibility that the Bitcoin experiment will succeed in El Salvador and motivate other countries to follow Nayib Bukeles path.Tonga is talking about adopting Bitcoin by the end of 2022 as are other countries in South and Central America. In short something is happening and the IMF feels the danger mounting for its obsolete system.Rather than letting the people determine for themselves the IMF is threatening El Salvador saying the country must abandon Bitcoin. The IMFs threats only justify in my opinion the very existence of Bitcoin and the absolute necessity for the world to have this alternative system available.Since El Salvador will logically refuse to obey the IMF whats next? Will America eventually orchestrate a coup in El Salvador to overthrow the government and end the Bitcoin experiment? How far are the powerful people in the current system willing to go to prevent countries from expressing their free will in monetary and financial matters?El Salvador must continue to resist outside pressure and other countries that will opt for the Bitcoin system in 2022 must do the same. The world is changing and the first countries to adopt Bitcoin will be the ones to benefit the most in the future.,46,0.91,65,2022-01-26 20:12:57

Stablecoin staking reaches up to 20% in APY. Its probably the safest and most profitable passive income right now.,I learned this the hard way during this crash. People who had big amount of stablecoins staked barely felt a thing and didnt panic as much as others.Im not gonna go all in on stablecoins but it would be nice to ensure a chunk of my wealth wont get wiped out each dip.Although I wouldnt get anywhere near USDT. Who knows when it will come crashing down.Would much safer to go with audited and fully backed stablecoins like USDC EURST and UST.Some well regarded platforms offer up to 20% APY for stablecoins. Would be a cool investment to sleep on for a couple of years and gain passive income from.,35,0.86,113,2022-02-02 04:04:20

Tip for people just starting out prioritize figuring out what trends youre NOT going to buy into write down those reasons and update over time. This will help cut away the noise (of endless new listings of crowds) and emphasize continuous learning, Its really the endless new listings that get people I think. For every coin you feel compelled by FOMO to look deep into it read all the Reddit posts read blogs etc. Its incredibly draining on your time and emotions and its insane how quickly youll lose your bearings and constantly second guess yourself with each new piece of information.Having a reasoned-out NO list will help you efficiently eliminate possibilities.Sample examples from my NO list **(just my personal opinion dont kill me pls)**Metaverse* I cant see how this would tremendously transform our experience of the digital world in a way that would make the overhead (hardware and software-wise) worth it. It simply has to be overvalued as it is.Web 3.0* Build it and they will come does not work in the business world (read the Lean Startup)* .Our internet arose far more organically. Hundreds of protocols from hundreds of different companies were continuously refined they withstood the test of time. They were then eventually standardised into the web we have today.Notice the asymmetry. Saying no to an entire trend like metaverse allows you to avoid the process of deep diving into every metaverse and metaverse-related coin rank them on their positive attributes and decide how much to invest. At most you only have to look into a few coins to get an idea of a trend before placing it on your NO list. Without a NO list of trends your FOMO-driven-ever-expanding-YES-list-of-coins will completely derail you.Also notice that a strong list of positive criteria naturally appears as the inverse of the reasons you write down in your NO list.Another related tipIn the event that a coin that you didnt see potential in moons you should be able to turn around and say to yourself that with the knowledge you had at the time you made the right decision the people that chose to buy in either knew more than you (which is fine remember its a continuous learning process) or got lucky.Hope this makes sense.Edit formatting,26,0.91,48,2022-02-07 10:19:12

Youd have to wait decades on a savings account to make the same amount of money that DeFi offers.,Yes there are some people who arent into crypto or dont even know about it at all. But then there are people who know about DeFi and its benefits yet choose to keep earning 0.1% in a savings account.You know you dont have to go all in on your savings right? Just give it a try with a small chunk of money.There are some projects like ALGO and Yieldapp app offering ultra high APYs for safe crypto assets like stablecoins.Why not try that out? Theyre relatively much safer than other cryptos and earn SO MUCH more than what banking offers.,24,0.82,106,2022-02-04 06:59:39

*** Please Dont Feed the Bears! ***,A few years ago I began investing in crypto. I did ok. Made some money and waspretty pleased with my self. Then came my first bear market. I tried to hold out butit just kept dipping. Maybe I dont have the knack for this after all? Maybe I dontbelong swimming on the deep end? So I sold my crypto and fed it all to the bears Ipanic sold. I broke even and felt a little relief. Then when the market rebounded asit always has. My meager 2K that I got back would have been 300K. But I was fine. I had a job. Paid my bills.And what crypto I owned was owned and it was mine. What I really owned washope. And when I sold it I owned nothing that had the potential to change my life.Just the day by day grind. Losing it would not have been the end of the world. Butselling was the end of that exhilaration and excitement of what might have been. Ididnt have the metal. You see I owned BTC ETH and more. We all know wherethose went and how it is now. So Now when Once I buy I consider the moneygone. When I do buy crypto now I hold. Im in this until the bitter end. Or aglorious future. I will not feed the bears my hope. So I will keep mv head down andstay silent. I wont give others a reason to bash me when crypto is in the red. Onthe other hand when crypto climbs (as it inevitably always does) when I am askedhow did you do it. I will also remain silent then also. Its a long line that will belittlewhen the bears feed. But it is also a long line asking how did you do this when thebulls run. If they didnt walk that road with me they would never understand and I dont owe them an explanation.,23,0.8,58,2022-01-22 19:49:13
In your opinion who are the best YouTubers to listen to? And why?,Ive been thinking about this for a while. If you have any threads showing good people to listen to thatd be sweet. My list isCoin Bureau - Hands down must YouTube Channel. No bull just straight info. No hype boy.Max Maher - The is both entertaining and tests things for you with results and warnings.Bob Loukas - Absolute banger. Only releases occasionally but you know this guy has a good grasp on the market.Crypto Love - His boomshakalaka is annoying as heck but the information he generally provides (other than his TA which is a bit trash) is often really helpful. He helped me discover CBBI & Rainbow Chart.Altcoin Daily - They mostly just read the latest news articles and talk about popular tweets etc. Their closeness with bitboy makes me a bit sus but they also interview other big names in the crypto media space.Tyler S - Hes a new addition and a lot of people boast about his TA for bitcoin. He seems okay with his TA. Hes generally pretty entertaining.Alex Becker - Anything Metaverse related. He bags on ADA heaps but he seems to be one of the most experienced lads within the gaming blockchain hemisphere.JRNY Crypto - Another good addition he releases vids every so often but hes often been praised as having an absolute foot on the market at all times.Cryptolution - I just really like his stuff hes quite factual and its easy to drift off into his info.Honorable MentionBenjamin Cowen - A lot of people like his cointent I like how hes straight up with his info but I just get bored watching his stuff.Blockchain Backer - Not really familiar with his works but apparently he called the 69k top. At least thats what I heard.&#x200B;Please let me know your favs!,24,0.88,174,2022-01-18 04:41:17

I need an autotrading app/website that can help me invest in bitcoin- one that isnt a scam,Im new to cryptocurrency and Im very interested in investing my savings into an autotrading website or bot. Ive noticed many of these websites are scams and we were scammed yesterday by quite a well known site and lost an investment worth $5000.Despite this I am still very interested in finding the right app or website or coach that can help me achieve my goal. I want to invest my money in bitcoin and ether specifically a website or app that can work with algorithms. I am still learning a lot and I realize I will make mistakes and lose money sometimes. Im not sure if this is the right place to ask for advice but I just want to know if anyone knows of any good autotrading bots/apps/websites that wont scam me? Any advice would be appreciated.  Just to add basically the website that did us in we made $3000 profit off of a $2000 investment they demanded we pay (upgrade our account) $10 000 in order to withdraw our money so weve lost it all as they have blocked our account unless we make payment. Are there sites who wont do this? I understand theres different packages available sometimes but its a bit ridiculous to be charged $10 000 to be able to access our money. They didnt make this clear at all when we contacted them in the beginning when depositing our money.,18,0.95,191,2022-01-14 07:38:22

Death Cross Is Here. Bitcoin Goes Below $40K. Is It Time To Panic? Its time to ask yourself the right questions.,The dreaded Death Cross is here for Bitcoin as the price of Bitcoin briefly dropped below $40K yesterday. Extreme fear continues to prevail in the market whereas just a year ago the price of Bitcoin was around $40K as well but everyone was in euphoria mode.Same price but different feelings.The reason? Most investors have a hard time stepping back and realizing that in March 2020 the price of Bitcoin bottomed out below $4K during the liquidity crisis at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.Now that Death Cross is here some people are wondering if its time to panic. You need to ask yourself the right questions about the current market conditions. Are you anxious? Stressed? Sad? Happy?Answering this question honestly will help you to get a better handle on your Bitcoin adventure. Some people are anxious while others are taking advantage of it to accumulate more. In my opinion it is an opportunity right now but thats just my opinion. No guarantees as always everyone has to see what their interests are to make the best decisions.Going back to this Death Cross many think it is a Bearish signal. In the last issue of the In Bitcoin We Trust Newsletter I explain that it is much more complicated than that. There have been 8 Death Crosses in the history of Bitcoin 4 have seen the price of Bitcoin fall in the following months. The other 4 saw the price of Bitcoin rise in the following months.As you can see there is nothing absolute since it is 50/50. This wont help you know how to position yourself but it will tell you that it is out of the question to panic in the current situation. What you need to look at is the on-chain data with BTC accumulation increasing and less and less BTC on the exchange platforms.This is not yet having an effect on the price of Bitcoin but it will in the coming weeks. Patience is the key in this phase of the market.In terms of resistance to hold for the current Bullish scenario to stay valid it is the $39K-$40K area that must hold. As long as we are above it no worries. If the price of Bitcoin were to break $38K things would get more complicated as I explain in the last issue of In Bitcoin We Trust Newsletter [**https//inbitcoinwetrust.substack.com/p/death-cross-is-here-bitcoin-goes**](https//inbitcoinwetrust.substack.com/p/death-cross-is-here-bitcoin-goes)Feel free to share your feelings and opinions on the current market situation.,17,0.67,116,2022-01-11 13:05:48

Why are smaller exchanges always better than the giants like Binance or Coinbase?,People usually go with Binance and Coinbase simply for the fact that theyre the most famous. Few are the ones that actually do research.Coinbase is pretty damn expensive and has very poor coin diversity.Binance has high coin diversity but has literally no customer service and has accessibility issues.I find a lot of other relatively smaller exchanges much better in that regard. I think CoinOvy is a great candidate honestly especially considering how intuitive it is for new comers.Out of the big exchanges maybe Kraken is the only decent one cause while it lacks in coin diversity it makes up for it with many other things.,15,0.77,89,2022-01-27 15:43:42

DAOs - what how pros & cons,# What is it?DAO stands for **Decentralised Autonomous Organisation**. At its core a DAO is a smart contract. A piece of code which defines the rules of how the organisation should run. Unlike traditional organizations there is no hierarchy to DAOs. To align interests of the organization with that of its members DAOs incentivize their users to achieve their goal. A key distinction from traditional organisation is that the control is decentralised.# How to form and use it?1. Establish a cause2. Funding phase3. Governance# Benefits* Transparency* Decentralisation* Strong Community# Downsides* Bugs in code* Delays from votingI made a 6 min video going into more details about each of these aspects and how are DAOs being used today.

I don‘t get what us interest rates should do to crypto,I mean okay the stock market if full of big business guys banks and so on. Of course „changing interest rates make them sell something or buy something. But as a crypto investor why would you care about something like that? I thought it‘s the average guy who invests in crypto. For me i don‘t care if my homeland rises any rates or do whatever. Why should i sell or buy my coins because of some decisions made by the government? And i repeat i understand (kind of) the reaction at the stock market but for the crypto scene i don‘t get it. Like oh wow 2% higher interest rates now i sell all of my btc and eth!(?) Do you guys know what i mean? And is there any really good reason it should have an effect? btw crypto is not just usa too.,11,0.67,92,2022-01-27 15:45:01

Invest early in oracles. Theyre the future of this market.,Blockchain would barely be operable without oracle confirmation. Smart contracts would simply not be work without outside information input.And especially considering the demand for dApps on the market is at a constant growth (Polygon alone has more than 3000 dApps as of now) make oracles all the more valuable in the future.This is exactly why this is the right time to invest in the top oracles of the market like DIA or Chainlink especially after the prices became way more affordable now.The market and the number of its users will most probably stay on the rise for a long while meaning that the quality of oracles will also increase considering they rely on users as validators for outside information.,10,0.79,72,2022-01-25 22:15:30

Experiences about crypto hardware wallet,Im going to buy a crypto hardware wallet because I already have a lot of cryptocurrencies which bought in the dip. I consider hardware wallets as the safest way to hold them. As I know there are many wallets in the market but I need one which supports important and not-important coins and tokens like memecoins. I saw a wallet called Prokey which supports many of them and I may decide buy this. Do you have any experience using this wallet? How is it? Should I buy Prokey or Trezor and Ledger?Trezor and Ledger are well known and I could find many contents and FAQs on the web but this Prokey wallet looks to be new in the market.Thats why Im asking this question here and I really need your help and experiences.,7,0.74,74,2022-01-29 21:16:23

Dont get lured by high APYs. Always remember if its too good to be true it most probably is,These projects will ultra high APYs are the reason many people consider DeFi to be a scam when in reality its really not. Just like any other sector in any market it has scamy projects that you need to look out from.There are many platforms that offer high but reasonable APYs like Algo and Beefy (especially with stablecoin staking) and others like AGFI which invest into multiple chains making it a much safer project to invest into.Basically watch out for high unreasonably high APYs or at least research well before investing into these projects.,5,0.7,96,2022-01-28 10:22:12

The national average APY on savings accounts is just 0.07% according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation - CNBC,And thats just the average meaning there even lower ones. Ive even come across people with 0.01% APY.This genuinely makes me wonder why some people still think this is a good passive income when there a much higher double digit APYs in DeFi.And a lot of them are actually very safe and non risky staking investments. Things like stablecoins staking are pretty safe along with platforms like AGFI similar ones that invest in multiple chains at once.I get that some people genuinely dont know that DeFi even is a thing but those who do and still have a savings account… what are you thinking??,7,0.78,68,2022-01-26 11:00:47

Whats the investment thesis for Bitcoin long term?,Hi.Why would we expect Bitcoin to increase in price over the next 10-15 years and not slow and steadily decline before being put out of existence? Ive followed Bitcoin for years and know quite a lot about its strengths such Andreas Antonopoulos The Five Pillars of Cryptocurrency. I also know that that a lot of rich individuals companies (like MicroStrategy) and even countries (like El Salvador) it buying bitcoin but still I see some risk factors that makes me question bitcoins future1. As we have some very big whales such as Max Kaiser which can probably move and manipulate the market for decades to come why would even more countries and such move to bitcoin and risk being at the mercy of such individuals? 2. Despite bitcoins superb unique qualities (ref the five pillars) which does solve some real problems for real people (especially in developed countries) why would we assume that Bitcoin will continue to be the crypto dominating this space and not being replaced by another crypto for this segment of bitcoin users? I mean bitcoin is great and all but being the first (and as of now the biggest) in the market for say hedging against government induced hyperinflation doesnt mean it will stay this way.3. If you subscribe to the notion that fiat money per definition is doomed due to inflation and government control its possible that bitcoin will remain an investing hedge by (wealthy) individuals and companies and  not become the money of the future. If so its possible that bitcon remains just a regular investment asset along side stocks and so forth. Ill stop there but I hope you see where Im going with this. For me theres a lot of ifs when it comes to the future of bitcoin and a lot of resources I find online seems to totally ignore risks like the ones I mention above so I though Id reach out to the crypto community to get some input.,5,0.86,42,2022-01-23 05:38:57

Advice on long term investment strategy,I want to periodically buy and stake to make a savings account for the long term. I have been doing some research and I cant convince myself on what to invest for the long run. First I thought of Bitcoin but if its going to be a monthly recurring buy then I dont know if its the best option for DCAing. Second stable coins but no benefits/worries with volatility. Finally I thought about buying CRO Nexo Eth or some other altcoins to enjoy the higher staking rewards on their respective platforms and lower price but still have the same problem as Bitcoin with DCAing and volatility.I would appreciate any advice if you are doing something similar or what would be the best option for you.,4,0.75,86,2022-01-19 05:02:22

Comments on my crypto journey so far..,I first started investing in stocks during the weed stock surge back in 2017. Suffice to say I lost a lot of money during that time as I invested a good chunk during all time highs. When it crashed I had lost quite a bit of money. Luckily I was still young and thought I had learnt from my mistakes and decided to carry on.Fast forward to April 2021; I made back my losses and was finally making a profit. I thought to myself why not start investing in crypto? So I invested $700 straight into ETH. But other than BTC and ETH I knew nothing about crypto and thought maybe I should figure this out. I downloaded and opened the Binance app and was instantly overwhelmed where would I start? Shortly after a buddy of mine came to me and mentioned how he and some other guys were making a crap ton of money investing in something called Safemoon. I was immediately convinced and had $1000 ready to invest. Then came the instructions… My goodness what a process. What the hell is a pancake swap? Poocoin? Is that for real? Many moons later I figured it out. Nothing can compare to the stress of transferring your crypto from one exchange to another without knowing if it will actually go through. But it did and all was well. I invested that $1000 into Safemoon and thought okay Ill see where Im at next week. Well I looked the next day and my wallet was up a couple hundred bucks. Was crypto really that easy? I dont care I was up. I decided to wait it out and see what happens. Fast forward a few months and I came across R/Cryptocurrency. Oh hey maybe I can talk about Safemoon and learn about other stuff here. Little did I know was I invested in what was known as the Darth Vader of crypto the dark side probably the worst possible investment I could possibly make. So I listened and cashed out my $1500 (more or less) of Safemoon and decided to start off fresh. I thought that more research in this BSC space was necessary since it seemed to be a popular up and coming place with lots of room to grow - it was also a place that everyone in R/Cryptocurrency told me not to go. The next place I decided to put my money in was a relatively new BSC token that paid BUSD rewards. Why the hell not? So I went and put in $1500 into EGC yet another token that the R/Cryptocurrency absolutely LOVES. Well let me tell you something that $1500 investment made me $6000 faster than almost any investment Ive ever done in my life. This BSC stuff is for real. So I dug deeper in my research. What I had learnt was that most BSC  investments arent going to take you anywhere. Many CAN earn you a profit only if you know WHEN to sell. One wrong move can spell the end of your investment. Therefore one strategy I had followed was to do as much research as I could on a specific project that interests me. If I felt that project was legit Ill throw some cash into it (ideally before launch on pinksale). Upon launch Id wait for the quick 2-3x and sell my initial investment. Simple as that! Now be forewarned that doesnt always work. There will always be those that dont shoot up there are those that drop on launch and then there are those that are rug pulled. I have had all situations happen to me but luckily I have made at least 2x gains more often than not because (I believe) of the research I do beforehand. Now about these tokens I invest in; lets be honest Most are a copy cat of the one I invested into previously. The code is the same the rewards are the same utilities may be similar. So whats the deal? The truth to me at least is that this is a new game and everyone wants a piece of the pie. Everyone wants to be the best and brightest newcomer with something new to offer. Safemoon did that then EGC did that with the BUSD rewards and now others are following along all with a tweaked approach. Not to say this is bad. How can it be bad if Im making money? The truth is that there are some teams out there with an amazing background with some great devs working behind the scenes. Two that come to my head are RematicEGC and Y-5 Finance; both teams are run by outstanding individuals with a great core team around them and amazing communities. They are two of the main reasons why I decided to put this piece together. This does not ignore the fact that many and most projects dont have the leadership or flat out ability to move forward and will probably fail miserably. Were going to see a lot of that; Probably 95% of these tokens will cease to exist in the near future. And you know what? That doesnt phase me one bit because Im in the business of making money. And tokens like RematicEGC and Y-5 are helping me do just that.Fine most people here want a stable investment; but who doesnt? Thats theoretically impossible. You never know what the almighty Bitcoin and etherium have in store for us tomorrow. There are so many people in this world that have lost millions in those two coins alone over the past few months. And yeah youre going to respond to me by saying yeah f*ck Bitcoin Im in sol or mana or whatever the hell else you decide is a safe investment. But lets be real no investment in crypto is safe. Some ARE safer than others but thats when you have to look at risk vs reward. Now looking at the tokens that get shit on by this entire sub the Safemoon the egcs etc. Theres been some shady stuff going around about them but you know what? We probably know more about these guys than we do Bitcoin. For all we know; Bitcoin can just be one giant rug waiting to be pulled however since its adopted by the masses we refrain from thinking that for btc as much as we would for Safemoon. All in all Im not going to give numbers but these BSC investments got me thinking differently about how I am going to invest my money going forward because Ive probably made more in the last 6 months than I have the last 6 years on the stock market. Will this last forever? Probably not. But I cant get greedy. I have to continue to follow my plan to a T to ensure I dont get carried away and not take in profits. But until then Ill keep trucking along making money I didnt think possible with the likes of Y5 Rematic EGC and Safemoon while many continue to keep calling them scams and rug pulls. All fine by me.,3,0.81,72,2022-01-21 05:27:38

Lets face it most people in the market came in trading memecoins,Listen I get it memecoins are a joke (thats the point though) and theyre not for the serious investor. And I understand when people tell me they dont want to invest in something made after a meme. Its not for everyone. But honestly who cares?When I started trading I came in here not for the tech not for the engineering I came to make money. And if you take a minute and be honest with yourself most of you did as well. Memecoins have even brought in many people as a joke showed them the market and left them inside for real. And nothing changes that! Coins like DOGE ELON SHIB… all put many of the people I talk to on the day to day in the market. You see most people from the outside will be too intimated to enter the market with its big words big risks and intensive background research but memecoins told them that you dont have to a programmer to trade and you dont have to be a computer scientist to invest. It might have lessened the seriousness of the market but it brought in many people the most of which chose to stay.,4,0.63,82,2022-01-16 17:22:08
Wallet configured as Deposit Only without Secondary Password or Seedphrase,This seems like a useful feature. Think about your hodl bag the stuff for your retirement that never gets touched. Maybe you DCA into it or buy when you have a windfall but its the stuff you dont touch unless you just retired or are going homeless. Wouldnt it be useful to to be able to configure a dedicated Wallet for this purpose that is Deposit-only by regular password. To Send youd have to provide something more; secondary password seedphrase something. An extra level of security is what Im thinking about. If someone steals your phone or PC or are using a key logger they cant just transfer out your bag. Im thinking now about those steel engraved seedphrase gadgets. You fill that in once and it goes into the safety deposit box and you never open it again until you retire. Then that device makes sense.

Need help with a new wallet using coinbase rn,Dissatisfied with CoinbaseHi RedditAbout a year ago i started mining with my gaming pc on nicehash as i bought a second gpu i switched to ethermine and a coinbase wallet. This was great until i bought other coins during Januarys dip so my question is is there an alternative with better seperation between the coins because coinbase bundles all assets into one [balance/overview](https//i.imgur.com/O0jaGqD.jpg) i would prefere a wallet that shows me the curves of each coin separately.Thanks for all help,2,0.67,10,2022-02-07 14:18:03

A discussion of the benefits of and costs of cryptocurrency regulation in the US, Let me preface this post by saying I am doing it for an econ project at school. Please go easy on me. Also most of what I am talking about is in regards to regulation in the US but if any international Redditors wish to add their thoughts please feel free to.I wanted to ask the general cryptocurrency public how they feel about regulation. I have not put much money into cryptocurrency (currently about $500) but feel that regulation is needed to make sure that it succeeds in the future. My main reasoning is because of how common scams and illegal activities are with cryptocurrency. Right now cryptocurrency is undergoing a lot of economic growth and has a lot of economic freedom however it has virtually zero economic security or stability. The FTC totalled nearly 7000 complaints of cryptocurrency investment scams from October 2020 through March 31 with losses totaling around[ $80 million](https//www.aarp.org/money/scams-fraud/info-2019/cryptocurrency.html). And with shit-coins and rug pulls becoming more and more common I think this number will continue to grow. Government regulation might be able to solve this issue at the expense of some of the growth and freedom decentralized finance has. Currently only [14%](https//www.fool.com/the-ascent/research/study-americans-cryptocurrency/) of Americans invest in cryptocurrency while [56%](https//news.gallup.com/poll/266807/percentage-americans-owns-stock.aspx) invest in stocks. With the regulation of cryptocurrency the % of people that invest will likely increase due to greater investor protection.However there are a lot of negatives that come with the regulation of cryptocurrencies such as higher taxes less freedom and the possibility of price drops. Regulation would also come into direct conflict with the founding ideals behind decentralized finance so would like to hear the subreddits take on how cryptocurrency is currently being regulated in the US as well as how they should proceed in the future.ThanksRamen_Yamen,2,0.75,43,2022-01-24 02:30:20
Low-Middle Income Investor Thats All-In-Or-Nothing in Crypto (Long Post),First of all I apologize for the very long post. This has been in my heart for several months already after missing out on a life-changing opportunity. Whether people get a chance to read this or not - its all good. I simply have nowhere else to express this. But if ever you were able to stomach the whole story I deeply appreciate taking your time through everything.Its been 3 days - I havent talked to my wife who is deeply worried actually I havent said anything at home at all. I feel extremely depressed - and the main reason is this - I am back at doing my nursing job which I extremely despise. Originally I was planning to resign from my work in November but I didnt cash out profits because of believing in diamond handing too much. Now the opportunity is gone I am stricken by deep regret everytime I wake up in the morning. Ive cried heavily four times this past week which Ive never done in my life which has heavily frustrated my wife as well.I never loved my career anyway in nursing. All I did before entering crypto last year was just go to my job and do video gaming afterwards for many years. I earned $3500 a month - my bills were $3300. I could only save $200 a month. I have a consumer proposal in place due to heavy financial mistakes in my 20s (I am 30 atm). When I entered crypto in February I found a passion. I completely quit gaming. In the morning I did crypto trading community seeking and keeping myself updated and went to work in the afternoon. I treated this as a second job. At first I started studying how to do TA/FA into Bitcoin and Altcoins and then I discovered Binance Smart Chain due to how fast the news about Safemoon spreaded. And from April to October I was mainly focused on blockchain projects. Scams here and there but with research luck and figuring out how to  manual snipe I was able to make a lifechanging amount of money. A lifestyle emerged which me and my wife was never able to afford - enjoying expensive hotels buying nice things such as fancy shoes and computer parts...it almost felt like infinite money. The excitement quickly died down after a few months as we were like Ok seems like weve enjoyed discovered new things due to money time to stop spending and just recirculate the capital into other things instead.Not only I was able to enjoy a different kind of lifestyle but I was able to give back to my loved ones. My mother who understood my situation as in poverty and deeply in debt - always gave and never asked anything back. This time I was able to give her unforgettable memories from a few roadtrips around Canada and even bought her an Ipad Pro to support her passion for baking. It was the happiness of giving and being able to give to my mom and stepdad that made me truly happier - even more happier than personal lavish spending. Truly 2021 was a complete 180 reverse in terms of comfort zone and spending power. Finally I was also able to afford as much groceries as we wanted (Even my Licensed Insolvency Trustee wondered how I afforded a $300 dollar budget on groceries a month).Also because of Cryptocurrency I finally realized that there was a completely different world out there that was only enjoyed by people with money connections and power. At first seeing people spend $3000 on ETH gas just to mint an overly-hyped NFT and just laughing when the floor price of their NFT went <0.001 - this made me sweat but eventually I did my best to inculturate around the communities I got in. I was surrounded by people who had thriving careers thats not like mine mostly business owners or were just plain born wealthy. Everybody had extra money to put into crypto and NFTs every paycheck. While my paycheck cant afford any more top-ups all my investment came from what Ive won in previous projects. I had limited resources unlike these people. I also dont remember meeting anyone in my same situation as being within the low-middle income and struggling to find an escape. These same people had access to a few private communities which almost always hosts private sales into legitimate BSC and ETH projects. So while I had days that I lost money or earned nothing I almost always see posts/screenshots of them turning 1 ETH into 90 ETH effortlessly. This made me frustrated most of the time because I grind and risk everyday for 8 hours before I go to work while they get approached by these developers to provide liquidity for them in exchange for tokens. The inequality between the poor and the rich always struck me hard and everyday I grew more frustrated on how I could escape this hell.It isnt about the money. I dont dream about having three lambos and a 10-bedroom house everytime I woke up. It was about freedom. And with freedom comes more time - the most valuable resource in the world that you will never get back. I have Diabetes and I got diagnosed when I was 27. As a healthcare worker familiar with this condition I know that I will probably not last to 50 years old. Heck I probably wont even make it to 40. But all I dreamed ever since was having enough financial freedom so I could have more time with my loving wife bear her children and have enough time and resources to take care myself and keep myself healthy as much as possible while I last. None of my goals in crypto had anything to do with having a lavish and unnecessary lifestyle. Having a taste of temporary freedom and money in 2021 allowed me to judge what I really wanted in life and I was able to truly discover what I really wanted - All I wanted was to keep my loved ones happy and to treasure memories with them.Im hoping at this point youve started to understand why I said All in or nothing in crypto - for most low-middle income people like me most of us will be stuck having a dream and praying for something lifechanging. But at the end of the day we have to return to our jobs and responsibilities. Every one of us have some sort of passion but just dont have enough time to pursue nor concentrate on it because of lack of time freedom and of course money/capital.Some people will say You should just invest what you can afford to lose - this doesnt really apply all the time to people like me. Basically what I can afford to lose is 0. But how do I set myself up for something potentially life changing if I put zero? Crypto and investing is always a gamble and if I put nothing then Id be stuck in the same career and employer-employee relationship for the years to come. This just isnt what I want for my wife and our future kids. How can I support my mothers retirement if I can barely support myself?By October I mitigated risk by transferring much of my blockchain investment earnings into BTC and Altcoins so as to diversify my portfolio as well.Before the huge BTC dip from $69000 in November my profit was in 6-figures. I was happy and was waiting for the right time to cash out on a specific project because everything was pumping. A BSC project that was sleeping in my portfolio suddenly exploded. I was about to cash out profits so I can pay two loans with one winning. But it crashed heavily when BTC dipped and just went on a descending spiral from November onwards. It was a lifechanging profit that I didnt take. My loans were at $40k and the value of the project was at $35k. It was 5k away from me cashing out. It descended while I continued to believe that it will do a reversal. It never did a proper reversal. Now the value of my investment is at $7k only.The lesson here was to always take profits when you can. But this trading mistake has haunted me ever since and has caused massive sadness in the past several weeks. I was supposed to resign from my work with that profit so I can put money into e-commerce ideas or studying Solidity to pursue building blockchain projects. But instead of that happening I had to go back to work into nursing. I just cannot live by paying bills using my cryptocurrency money. Its especially frustrating when I keep seeing people making big profits in this current market situation while my portfolio is in constant decline. My portfolio went from around $170k in November into $61k as of today.Clearly this is taking a heavy toll on my mental health as I mentioned at the start of this post. I am haunted by previous trading mistakes the fact that I had to go back into my career which I despise being surrounded by people who are continuing to make profits at the moment while my money is in decline. I havent had sex in weeks havent had a meaningful conversation with my wife for the past few days as I am just completely withdrawn at home.Another reason for sadness and regret was the people i invested emotions into as friends in this space were the same bridges that had to be burnt. An expensive lesson I had in crypto and life in general is that you will be judged based on your value use and results. I thought I made friends in crypto but there was a point where we agreed to make a blockchain project. I did my best to contribute as much as I can but my talent/skills was just not relevant in Crypto. They were in sales marketing people skills and software while I was in healthcare. When the first project failed they chose to do a project by themselves without me knowing. I discovered it the hard way and when I asked about the reason I was given the answer that it was all about skill/payment dilution - nothing personal.Not really an important note but one of the trading mistakes that I incurred which is also a regret and have been haunting my mind was completely selling all my BabyDoge ICO tokens. I sold them the same day for $2500. As of today it would have been $3500000.Thanks for listening for those who took their time to read all of this. Any suggestions or constructive feedback would be greatly appreciated. I am extremely frustrated at my state of life at the moment but the burning passion of escaping this hell cycle is still here. I still dream of the time that Cryptocurrency will bring me the freedom I need to spend time with my loved ones and being able to focus on diet exercise and exercising a healthy mindset to delay the decline of my overall health due to my condition. It will be difficult for me to change my mindset that sticking to a job will lead to anything lifechanging especially in healthcare.Sorry for the wordings and expressions. I came from a difficult 8-hour shift and about to sleep after sending this.,2,1.0,42,2022-01-22 12:42:48
What is a Decentralized Exchange?,For the people who have not heard about a decentralized exchange platform let me explain what does a decentralized exchange platform is. As the name of the platform says it is a [**decentralized exchange like 1inch**](https//www.zeligzwebstore.com/decentralized-exchange-like-1inch) platform that is not controlled by a third party or a middleman. With the help of blockchains features and smart-contract automation advanced functionality and features are embedded in the decentralized platform.All the different types of DEX platforms offer different functionalities to the users. Not only the charges to use the platform differs but liquidity offered speed and other features differ simultaneously.,3,0.71,65,2022-01-21 10:55:09
Crypto and NFTs seems like completely different concepts ,While the crypto world is in chaos NFT traders are having the time of their lives. Top crypto coins dipped and havent gone back to their previous ATH levels let alone smash them. NFTs have always been a sorted out commodity Ive seen NFT sales start and end in minutes just like when Tory Lanez launched his When its Dark NFT album and sold 1 million copies in a minute for a dollar each thats quite ironic and a unit has been flipped for $50000 already.Just like how Unique Network also sold out its first NFT chain in minutes at the Hackusama 2020 Substrapunks were made as a tribute to Cryptopunk. This proves that they will always be money moving through NFTs as the price is set by the profile they were minted.This is proof that the Defi world will never be static. If you want to gain from your investments you have to be ready to stay on the run always. Its no longer as simple as it was years ago when folks just bought Bitcoin waited for the prices to pump and sold them at a profit.You could at least try different ideas and projects to see what works for you. If you dont see your luck trading try joining startup projects such as AGFI (Aggregated Finance). Here you can have all your investments handled on your behalf and returns shared with you. If youve run out of luck and feel crypto might not be your thing after all venture into NFTs maybe. Its a part of the space but feels like a completely different realm altogether at this point.,0,0.5,75,2022-01-21 06:13:23

Cryptocurrencies solving real world problems and how they have done it How XRP came into play ,International payments are time-consuming and costly. Because international payments are so slow companies must keep trillions of dollars spread around the globe in order to make domestic payments to suppliers. This is both inefficient and expensive.The ultimate goal is to use XRP (a settlement asset that can be transferred in a matter of seconds) and ILP (a protocol for discovering and coordinating transactions across multiple ledgers) to connect payment systems so that money can move as easily as information does today.Now that XRP is more mainstream its price has remained stagnant for the past three years owing primarily to a lawsuit. However XRP remains one of the best practical use cases and there is a strong likelihood of a price increase once the lawsuit is resolved.Another coin is the Bob Eco Coin which is creating thousands of jobs and declaring war on pollution through the Security Tokens world. It also offers programmes such as social impact environmental impact and educational opportunities.These are a few projects that I believe should be on checklist.,2,0.6,63,2022-01-20 11:56:47

Never trust exchanges with your money,Would you trust me with your money? Then why would you trust another human being with your money. Humans are humans and they will fail under temptation it could be today or whenever. But only put your trust to systems that are highly and arent run by emotional beings.Do not trust creators who are fallible only put your trust in algorithms and math. Because math never lies. This is what decentralization was supposed to mean to begin with. That the system would not be regulated by a select few but everyones money would be secured by everyone. And this is all based on mathematical irreversible formulas. And this is why DeFi always wins and would always be superior. This is why I only choose DeFi for my investments and portfolio. Even the exchanges you use for your DeFi matter. I like exchanges who are open and indiscreet about their regulation and systems funds and loans and all. Systems like Werewolf exchange with their DeFi protocol. They are run pretty well and I give them my full faith. Because they give me my DeFi security and dont try to cheat me out with difficult rules that I would not easily understand. DeFi will be triumphant in the end. And will be the be-all end-all of all crypto. It makes perfect sense and compliment every aspect crypto wanted. This is why it will stand until the end.,1,0.53,67,2022-01-30 15:59:14

3 Potential Scenarios for Bitcoin Price in 2022. The Bullish the Boredom and the Bearish.,The price of Bitcoin has broken out of the $40K-$42K range that had replaced the $46K-52K accumulation range it had been in since the beginning of December 2021. However Bitcoin is not out of the woods. Until the Bitcoin price breaks above the $52K resistance it is not possible to rule out the Bearish scenario in the short term.For now the Bitcoin price is around $43K and $46K is the next crucial resistance to breakthrough. It may take some time and it may be tested several times. The $40K-$42K area seems to be an important accumulation area with many Whales and institutional investors positioning themselves.The funding rates are mostly negative which is also a Bullish sign. Bitcoin reserves on exchange platforms are at a 4-year low which is a clear sign of the growing long-term confidence of all Bitcoin investors.However it also means that the number of players in the spot market is smaller. De facto the price of Bitcoin is much more volatile and until a spark occurs in the spot market the price could remain in this accumulation zone which would become a boredom zone for many investors.Based on these preliminary observations I propose to look at 3 possible scenarios for the price of Bitcoin in 2022 to help you prepare for it on all levels. Three scenarios the Bullish the Boredom and the Bearish.* **Scenario 1** Bitcoin continues its accumulation phase between $40K and $50K before starting a new Bullish wave to reach $100K in Q2 2022* **Scenario 2** Bitcoin continues its Bullish and Bearish movements. These follow one another as they have since late summer 2020 until the next Halving* **Scenario 3** Bitcoin suffers the effects of the macroeconomic environment and enters a Bear Market until the next HalvingI detail these three scenarios in the latest issue of In Bitcoin We Trust Newsletter [**https//inbitcoinwetrust.substack.com/p/3-potential-scenarios-for-bitcoin**](https//inbitcoinwetrust.substack.com/p/3-potential-scenarios-for-bitcoin),1,0.55,86,2022-01-17 18:23:32

The 5 Big Reasons Why Bitcoin Will Be a Major Force for Good in the Fight Against Climate Change,>History repeats itself.This fundamental truth of life is not mine but that of Thucydides an Athenian philosopher and politician who was born in 460 BC and died in 397 BC. If youve been around the Bitcoin world long enough youll see that this applies perfectly to the behavior of Bitcoins opponents.Their attacks on Bitcoin go round and round and every outdated cliché comes back to the forefront in a cyclical fashion. For several months you will hear from the powerful in the current system that Bitcoin is dangerous and used only for illegal activities.Then economists will come along and denounce Bitcoin as a Ponzi scheme. Finally when Bitcoins opponents feel that the general public is tiring of these false attacks they will switch to another cliché>Bitcoin is an environmental disaster.We are currently in the middle of this cycle where Bitcoin is being attacked for its allegedly disastrous consequences on the environment. I say alleged here because the people who are attacking Bitcoin in this way do not understand that Bitcoins energy consumption is a good thing. The Proof-of-Work the consensus algorithm at the heart of the Bitcoin system is what makes Bitcoin unique and superior. It absolutely must be preserved and will be.If you take a step back to form your own opinion you will probably come to the same conclusion as all Bitcoiners Bitcoin will be a major force for good in the fight against climate change. Ill give you the 5 big reasons why I believe this in the latest issue of In Bitcoin We Trust Newsletter1. Bitcoin boosts energy development2. Bitcoin drives demand for renewable energy development3. Bitcoin mining companies are under pressure to have a maximum ESG score4. Lightning Network will decouple Bitcoin transactions from the mainnet power consumption5. Bitcoin allows us to opt for a low-time preference vital to preserving the planetAll the details are here [**https//inbitcoinwetrust.substack.com/p/the-5-big-reasons-why-bitcoin-will**](https//inbitcoinwetrust.substack.com/p/the-5-big-reasons-why-bitcoin-will),0,0.47,50,2022-01-25 15:49:31

MEMECOINS are making a massive comeback mark my words,I know the current sentiment of Reddit against memecoins and I know this opinion will be misunderstood and hated before it is fully read. But memecoins will be back and heres why.If you pay a close look at how memecoins work they follow a certain cyclical pattern.1. They start rising very slowly2. Suddenly they boom3. They quickly disappear as fast as they came4. Long phase where they are no longer relevant5. The cycle repeatsAnd thats clearly happening because of something very simple large groups are pulling off this scheme to make big money and it works every time. Ive heard of whale groups who target a tiny memecoin and slowly buy their way in (DCA) then create false hype about this coin through social media they sell at the peak of the hype and they leave you with your bags.*This is fairly obvious and should be common knowledge. However this poses the question how may we benefit from this? Well by simply riding the waves.*Ive had this work out for me during the early DOGE days I noticed it in early 2020 starting to rise out of nowhere and I know a plot was being brewed so I bought in a little. Then suddenly elon and everyone was talking about it so I sold before the massive crash. The cycle will repeat mark my words. Pay close attention to DOGE SHIB and ELON. **You could either surf this to the end or you could let it crash on your head.**,0,0.43,69,2022-01-23 06:58:38

Snapshot of $RAT holders at midnight EST 18/01 | Own a fraction of Banksy as an NFT | RATbits the first platform to truly fractionalize NFTs, At 11.59pm EST a snapshot will be taken of all $RAT holders on the Ethereum network and their  holding! Each holder will get a fraction of a Banksy NFT which will be distributed to them as an  individual NFT proportionate to their holding of $RAT!To put it simply the more $RAT you hold the larger portion of the Banksy youll receive as an NFT. If  we have 1000 holders then 1000 fractions will be distributed ranging from anywhere to a 10% $RAT  holder receiving 10% of the painting to a 0.1% holder receiving a fraction proportionate to their 0.1%  holding!**Fractionalization**Fractionalization currently exists by smart contracts being created of the NFT and fractions being  distributed as tokens. The Rare Antiquities Token ($RAT) has created the worlds first platform that  fractionalizes NFTs and distributed the fractions as individual NFTs. And they go one step further by  making each fraction proportionate to the users holding of $RAT meaning every holder will receive a  different % of art.  The more $RAT you hold the more of the Banksy you hold!**Background**The Rare Antiquities Token (RAT) was launched on the Ethereum network 4 months ago and is  currently sitting comfortably at around 600% above the launch price and is on a steady upward trend  leading to the release of the RATbits.com NFT Marketplace/Platform.With a team of 12 strong covering project management product management delivery UX/UI  design and more the team has delivered a technology first in the NFT space.**The Future**With the company now based in Dubai with their Middle East subsidiary they are speaking at the NFT  Expo with WOW Summit [https//wowsummit.net/](https//wowsummit.net/) in March.

BabyTether 💸 Hold $BabyTether — earn $USDT ✅ CERTIK audited & passed KYC ✅ New Reflection GEM on BSC! 💎 Pre-sale on January 22!,**Join TG** [**https//t.me/BabyTetherApp**](https//t.me/BabyTetherApp)# Introduction*BabyTether is a new token in the Binance Smart Chain network which allows each holder to receive permanent passive earnings paid in $USDT.**What could be more stable and more confident than receiving rewards immediately in $?**Every week tokens appear that pay rewards to holders in the form of other tokens (BNB CAKE ADA AVAX Dogecoin and so on). You depend at once on the price of two tokens on the token that you are holding and on the other token in which you are credited with rewards. Of course you can immediately sell the second token and convert it into dollars but these are unnecessary actions an unnecessary waste of attention and inconvenience. Especially if you are relaxing somewhere on the islands drinking Pina Colada. Or you can hold the token that you receive as a reward but this is an additional risk. The risk of the market falling respectively of this token.**Our team really likes the idea of ​​projects that pay rewards to holders immediately in the form of stablecoins (USDT BUSD). But in reality there are very few such high-quality projects on the market. That is why we are here!**Think about it. Why do you need extra actions? Why do you need additional risk which is already enough in cryptocurrency? We do not see the need for this and are more inclined towards stability to constancy. And there is nothing more stable in cryptocurrency than stablecoins. Regardless of the market whether it goes up or down you will always know that you have dollars in your portfolio that you can always use in real life. Better yet when the market falling you will have the funds to buy back the altcoins (which other projects offer you as rewards haha) at even lower prices.**BabyTeather is not just a meme token without functionality. Our team wants to make a great story out of this project. Something like BabyDogeCoin.. A wonderful project and wonderful admins. And we intend to repeat their success but in a much more stable and acceptable form for ordinary people.**If you give a choice to an ordinary person who is not very familiar with cryptocurrency to buy a coin and receive rewards for it in CAKE/BNB/Dogecoin.. or in $ what will he choose? The answer is obvious. And our mission is to distribute BabyTether not in a narrowly focused way only in the cryptocurrency community but by embracing a large number of ordinary people who are just starting to study the cryptocurrency world.*# Features**7% Redistribution in USDT**  7% of every buy/sell is taken and redistributed to all holders. Hold $BabyTether tokens earn USDT. A Minimum of 200000 tokens is required in order to receive rewards.**Rewards Paid Automatically**  For the first time ever you dont need to claim your earned USDT. Its automatically sent to your wallet. Just add the Tether USD token ($USDT) address to your wallet and youre set.**Dashboard**  [https//dashboard.babytether.app/](https//dashboard.babytether.app/)  Our convenient dashboard optimized for any device will help you easily track and claim your rewards and monitor the current state of the BabyTether token.**3% Liquidity Pool**  3% of every transaction is converted into liquidity for PancakeSwap. Its automatic and helps create a price floor (stability).**1% Sell Fee**  An extra 1% fee is applied to all sells. This will allow us to reduce swing-trading and break whales control.**Secured By Design**  Initial Liquidity Provided is locked with PinkSale. Fully Audited by CERTIK & InterFi.**Massive Marketing Plan**  5% of every transaction is allocated to Marketing in USDT. This allows us to fuel our most ambitious projects in service of further rewarding our community.

It is enough to make a payment directly with your bank card after which you will receive BNB to the specified wallet which you can exchange for BabyTether tokens in the Swap tab. # Dividend Distribution MechanismThe dividend mechanism incentivizes token holders to hold in order to earn dividends from the transactions (buys and sells).    The dividends are not dependent on the price of BabyTether. They are based purely on the volume and proportional to the BabyTether amount you hold in your wallet.* All $USDT the contract gains are split proportionally between the token holders* To receive dividends a minimum token balance of 200000 BabyTether is required to be held in a wallet* The contract keeps track of all the dividends due to each holder in a list* Every transaction processes a certain number of users from the list* The number of holders processed through each transaction is dynamic and based on transaction size* Holders will receive dividends from the queue based on their position in the list* Its a fair system fully automated# Security**The BabyTether team has taken several steps to ensure optimal security**1.

Weve seen that happen especially with all recent DAOs and OHM forks.At PanStake were aiming to prevent that from happening by building a community owned treasury from taxes and simply stake it on PancakeSwap. We think this will provide us with a good and stable revenue stream on both short and long term that will only keep growing over time. We will then actively use that revenue to distribute part of it as passive income to holders buy-back and burn our own token to maintain price stability and re-stake the rest.&#x200B;**📊 Buy and Sell tokenomics - 12% tax*** **6%** of every buy or sell transaction goes to the treasury.

This ensuring long terms passive income for investors and a sustainable future for the project.* **2%** of every buy or sell will be distributed to holders as incentive to hold while waiting for staking profit distribution.* **2%** of every buy or sell transaction goes to the marketing wallet to help us spread the word invite more investors to join and help more people build their passive income by participating in our ecosystem.* **2%** of every buy or sell transaction serves as incentive for the team to keep the project going and properly manage the treasury. It may also be used to fund any development requirements.&#x200B;**💵 Profits distribution tokenomics*** **12%** of the staking profits will be re-invested back into the project by distributing it on the treasury marketing and team wallets.* **79.2%** of the staking profits will be distributed back to all investors proportionally to their holdings in $PANS.* **8.8%** of the staking profits will be used to buy-back and burn $PANS making the token hyper-deflationary by design.&#x200B;**👩🏻‍💻 The PanStake team*** **Rachel** - Founder & head of development (Telegram **RachelJone**)* **Max** - Co-founder & head of marketing (Telegram **MaxAvelin**),179,1.0,27,2022-02-03 18:37:39

UpCRO on Cronos. It goes up against CRO,**The Era of DeFi isnt fading rather it is gaining momentum with innovative tech solutions like UpCRO**. UpCRO takes an entirely unique approach to complex mechanical design and ecosystem expansion while always trying to look at markets from new perspectives. UpOnlyTokens uses a fully refined market structure based on volume and they never go down in price.In the quest to add flavour to users crypto journey through viable Crypto projects UpCRO is proud to announce their launch on the 25th of January 2022. Users can join the market generation event on the said date.The chances for this project to scale is guaranteed and this is owing to the fact that the team responsible for this project have been in the Cryptocurrency space for almost 2 years with wide exposures and experiences in the space.Empire team a partnering body to UpCRO will use ERC 31337 standard version also called the elite token which will be put into the Uniswap fork by the team.A simple description of UpCRO Market Generation Event is as follows; 275% efficiency is earmarked with the raised funds as shown below;– Liquidity 144%– Referral buy 1.11%– Group buy 55.55%– Market stabilization buy 23.69%– Drip Vault buy 19.63% (new)– Marketing Vault 11%– Vault 20%– Dev 23.69%– Vesting Period Length 15 days# Market Generation Event (MGE)Market Generation Event shows the potential that lies in spending the same value twice using ERC-31337 token wrapper. Users should be patient with UpCROs team and also stay resilient as UpToken launches are designed to be as fair as possible.When the Generation Phase ends and pools are created all of the token supply will be locked into liquidity with no available chance for further minting. Users can also benefit from the token by entering with CRO on the CRONOS blockchain or enter with BNB on the BSC blockchain on [upcro.finance](https//upcro.finance).The team will take care of the conversion and pay the gas fees while the users who entered with the BSC blockchain will be able to claim on CRONOS.# Innovative FeaturesUpCRO is open to launching multiple innovative features which includes; marketing vault drip fault and amazing features on DeFi. The drip Vault will offer the opportunity for a multi-layered double auto-compounding staking system with predictable APY. Marketing is the live wire of a business blockchain inclusive and with so many tokens comes expectations to propage the benefits of the token. The marketing vault will provide long-term success by adding a dedicated marketing vault to the project system.# Notable AchievementsOver the past 12 months UpCRO have released two versions of a token that soars upon buy and sell. So far theres been a launch of 4 UpTokens in total each with Market Generation Events. Thus earning UpCRO the mention for the team that has launched the most tokens.# Futuristic PlansFollowing the achievements in the past 12 months it is expected that in the next 12 months a thorough release schedule of system update per month will be instituted.In order to ensure efficiency in transfer fees are expected to be sent to contracts to split after larger amounts have been collected.The Fee splitter can be set to collect fees for any number of tokens. The owner of the contract will simply set the ratios and then set the number of receivers to collect portions of the fees in either UpTokens or the paired token.The burn function will be enabled on the contract as this will help reduce the supply which will help increase the price floor and unlock more value from the gem.Redistribution of the collected token will be ensured without any changes and this will support staking contracts.**Medium** [https//medium.com/@upcro](https//medium.com/@upcro)**Website** [http//upcro.finance](http//upcro.finance/)**Twitter** [https//twitter.com/up_cro](https//twitter.com/up_cro)**Telegram** [https//t.me/upCRO](https//t.me/upCRO)**Discord** [https//discord.gg/hMcnrthnSS](https//discord.gg/hMcnrthnSS),128,1.0,12,2022-01-23 16:16:32

I Found How To Trade cryptocurrencies without KYC (Withdraw as much as 20 BTC daily without identity verification),   If youre like me and right now dont want to give your identity to your crypto exchange i got some good news I found a really cool exchange called Bitget is one of the top derivatives exchanges(very nice liquidity I must say) and apparently the number one copy trade platform of the world which is an amazing feature BTW.   The most interesting thing that I love the most about this exchange is that it doesnt require KYC for you to trade crypto (Bitcoin Ethereum etc) on spot futures or do copy trading (Basically you dont need to give your ID to enjoy most of their services). And even better you can withdraw as much as 20 BTC daily without completing the identity verification.   Ive been using them for over 4 months and I havent had any inconvenience the interface works flawlessly and the phone app is very smooth  nothing to envy to Binance Coinbase or any Tier 1 exchanges.   To register in Bitget please use my referral link to get 25% fees discount you wont regret it buddy [ https//partner.bitget.com/bg/Zfqiaq](https//partner.bitget.com/bg/Zfqiaq) enter your email and youre ready to start trading right away! Good luck!!This is the information you can read at Bitgets websiteKindly reminder- Minimum withdrawal amount 0.001. The maximum amount cannot exceed the amount available in your account.- It is recommended that you complete KYC verification to improve account security; **daily total withdrawal amount for the unverified account is 20 BTC**; daily total withdrawal amount for the verified account is 200 BTC.- Please make sure that your device and browser are secure and your information is protected from being tampered or leaked.I Hope this information is useful for you guys. Happy trading,105,0.97,15,2022-01-27 16:54:56

Will Blockchain/Cryptocurrency ever conquer the Adult Entertainment Sector,With the rapid spread of **COVID19** through the world during the last 2 years and governments confining people in their houses most subscription networks (**Netflix Amazon etc**) had a huge increase in viewers and memberships unlike any other period.This of course also extended itself to the **Adult Industry**. Better rates cheaper prices also lead to the increase of transactions through cryptocurrencies.Adult Industry moved around **$97B** in **2021** worldwide and its expected to more than double by 2025.But has the adult industry really picked any steam in the crypto world so far despite being one of the few industries that keep growing in revenue each year? In 2018 Phub tried to get cryptocurrencies on board only to be blocked by Visa and Mastercard. Despite this setback more and more adult crypto projects are turning to blockchain crypto and as of 2021 the **Metaverse.**Lets that a look at some of the best adult related crypto projects out there**Just For Fans -** Can any company compete at this point with Only Fans? No doubt that this platform had a huge growth in the last 2 years but Just For Fans is considered an alternative to OF. Not a crypto project in all sense of those works but JFF does accept payment in BTC unlike OF.**CumRocket -** Creators of the digital currency Cummies this platform is a mix of NFTs marketplace with chatting and subscribing to your favorite content creators. Featuring already more than 200 creators it only launched in April 2021 so it is quite literally still in its infancy. At some point in June Elon Musk gave the impression he was shilling CumRocket when he tweeted a couple of enigmatic tweets without ever mentioning the project. Following this the price rose from 0.06 to 0.28 in 15 minutes. Like many projects Cummies surge was short-lived.**Spankchain -** Creator of SpankPay along with Just For Fans is meant to be an easy and decentralized way for adult content creators to accept and get paid via cryptocurrency. They aim to be the go-to tool for buying anything from naughty videos to adult toys. Just recently they also released their Spank Pop Shots NFTs a pack of 4 adult NFTs with top models and even videos.**Bitcci -** Bitcci has a native payment token called Bitcci Cash Token that has already been advertised with more than 200 outdoors in Switzerland. Key among these is the Bitcci Nightclub Network (bNN). bNN is a network of physical sauna clubs that bitcci intends to build globally. We are still yet to see if they will be successful or not**Splash -** Lets say Splash is one of the new players in town. According to their website they are already supported by numerous adult actresses and actors Like famous adult legends Sunny Lane and Riley Steele and directors such as Jeff Mullen and Rick Garcia among many others.Also with their own unique Splash marketplace you can buy $Splash and purchase NFTs. It seems to me that (according to their own roadmap) one of their big advantages will be their approach to the current trend of the metaverse with the future deployment of a VR gallery in the works.In conclusion it seems to me that although the adult industry and crypto still have a long way to go the potential is there. For me what will influence mostly the success or failure of such projects will be their adaptability to major driving tech factors like Virtual Reality and the down prices for HMD (Head Mounted Displays) adoption of adult-themed NFTs on a large scale and how they will adapt themselves to a possible adult Metaverse.Hope you guys liked this article and more so I would like to know what are your thoughts?,85,0.96,33,2022-01-11 11:58:19

Miners DeFi Coin - MINERS just got major PR In Yahoo News about to go Parabolic I Legit Coin backed by over 115 K in Real BTC Mining Hardware Asics I Insane potential,I normally trade larger MC coins or invest directly in startups but every once in a while I come across a real gem in the micro cap space. I wanted to share with all of you in this sub because Ive learned so much from this place and hope I can make a real difference in someones life by sharing this alpha. $MINERS is a token that pools money to fund cutting-edge Bitcoin mining and pays out BTC rewards to every holder. They already have a mining facility set up with hydropower in Siberia. The founder is a massive influencer and flew to Siberia himself to finalize the partnership setup and film the facilities.A portion of the tax goes to a mining wallet which then gets used to buy mining hardware. They did a soft launch back in September and acquired over 115K of mining hardware already which is generating a continuous income stream for the coin and its holder. They just completed a massive rebrand process started major PR (google Miners DeFi and youll see) and are about to kick their marketing into high gear. The team has plans to launch an updated live mining dashboard an NFT platform a game and a DAO to give the community more control over the token.Were getting in super early so this is SUCH a good bet. Every single coin founded by an influencer has skyrocketed. I hear that they have a massive marketing plan with YouTube videos scheduled for every single day and they retained a major PR agency called Interdependence. Also theyre already starting to go viral on Twitter. This is insane. MC right now is ridiculously low at around 1M and ATH of 5M this is a really good opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a serious project. **Tokenomics**&#x200B;* 13% transaction tax   * 4% to mining wallet which will be returned tenfold to holders after profits   * 4% reflections/rewards in BTC meaning all holders will be receiving a passive income!   * 2% to LP increasing the stability and value of the coin with each transaction (LP is already super high - normally id think this is low but in the case of $MINERS it works!)   * 2% to Marketing to provide a stable budget for marketing expenses* 1 quadrillion total supply -- 50% burned immediately! And constant burns--the coin is hyper-deflationary.* 20% was sold through the presale 20% Pancakeswap V2 listing* &#x200B;Contract 0xeb6b00f8c7e1da78fb919c810c30dde95475bdde  Telegram [https//t.me/minersofficial](https//t.me/minersofficial)  Website https//minersdefi.com/  Twitter https//twitter.com/minersdefiAs always DYOR.

{Discussion and thoughts?}{OPCT Opacity - Private Storage Coin}-130 mil total fixed supply- Market cap $23.9 million. Huge potential smaller market cap arounf $24 million. Looking at the fundamentals i feel this is a long term hold. Highly Undervalued compared to most other small cap storage coins., **Introduction**Im looking at Opacity for the fundamentals and to be long term storage coin hold. i feel that storage is going to be huge part of web 3.0 and for web 3.0 to work properly we need coins like $fil$storj$AR all these are all great but all have big market caps with nothing like opct has. Online privacy is more important than ever right now with tech giants like Facebook and Google having no respect for peoples privacy.Opacity is a private and anonymous storage provider where you dont even need an email address to set up an account and your uploaded files are encryped client-side and chunked so that not even the Opacity team knows which files are yours or what they are. Ease of use is the other main selling point of Opacity.**Current state**The most up to date and easiest way of using Opacity is by using the webapp that reached version 2.0 earlier in 2021 and its very user friendly.The current downside is that Opacity is not decentralised but Sia will be added very soon as a storage provider and as a stepping stone to full decentralisation. As a long term goal Opacity aims to become a gateway for storage providers including both large enterprises like Amazons AWS to Sias or Storjs network with the main added benefit being the privacy and anonymity layer.Each OPCT is currently worth 64GB but that will change as soon as full decentralisation kicks in since anyone running a node will be able to charge what they want for their provided storage. With decentralisation it will also be possible to stake your coins.Due to current issues with Ethereum fees OPCT is also available as a wrapped version on the Polygon network. Another small but important point is that Opacity has a hardcap of 130 million tokens with all tokens having already been distributed.**Coming very soon**There is an upcoming mobile app which will be released very soon (currently in the last stages of beta testing) which is huge because it targets a much larger group. The Sia node development is currently being worked on and should also be released soon which means that Opacity will very soon be decentralised.**UPDATE i have been using the app for a little while now..**I have used this app for a couple days and i have to say its very user friendly and you really dont need to know much about Crypto to use the storage you get 10gb for free to play around with. Im very impressed by the ease of use and the ability to market this to a wider market outside of the crypto**Market**Opacity currently has a market cap of $23.7 million which compared to FILs $5 billion leaves it with a huge amount of room for growth. How many other smallcaps with a working product are there even out there? Thats one of the many reasons I believe that its still hugely undervalued.,50,1.0,23,2022-01-17 02:10:30

⚡️ $FCF has booked a PLATINUM booth at the DUBAI crypto expo!| FCFPay Beta Phase is Live - Empowering Crypto 🚀 | 500+ Merchants already signed up for FCFPAY| Certik Audited| A true crypto-to-crypto payment gateway for ecommerce and physical retail stores | Earn Daily dividends on each transaction!, French Connection Finance has booked a PLATINUM booth in the most prestigious crypto expo in the world!FCF representatives will be attending CRYPTO EXPO DUBAI 2022 on March 16-17. They even have a 20-minute on-stage presentation that will broadcast FCF and FCFPAY to the world!Another exchange listing has been confirmed for the 3rd week of February! This will bring huge exposure to the project.REBRANDING is imminent! In order to avoid any confusion whatsoever regarding the fact that FCF is 100% a utility project a new corporate image is about to be revealed. The utility launch marketing plan will also begin in earnest in the days and weeks to come.Over 500 Merchants have already signed up to accept crypto payments for their goods and services through FCFPAY!$FCF is a revolutionary token developing a crypto payment gateway called FCFpay. It integrates with the two biggest e-commerce platforms – WooCommerce & Shopify. But FCFpay doesnt stop there… The flexible API allows it to be integrated into practically any existing payment system even in physical retail stores! In fact a large proportion of the first merchants to use it will be physical stores.Imagine paying directly with crypto! You will soon be able to shop online or in person and spend your crypto gains without having to send them to the bank or use a crypto credit card that is actually just swapping your crypto for fiat. Crypto is about to fulfill its true purpose as the CASH of the internet!FCF Pay will for example allow you to buy flowers with BNB and order food with Cardano (or any other crypto)... just about any combination you can imagine and all without requiring you to use a traditional offramp such as a centralized exchange.This will allow FCF to unite the $4 trillion-dollar online shopping industry with the cryptocurrency world. This unification positions FCF to lead the way towards mass adoption and secures the future of FCF as an essential crypto technology!Thats why their motto is EMPOWERING CRYPTO!$FCF was already listed on 4 exchanges over a period of just 4 weeks! LBANK HOTBIT COINSBIT AND LATOKEN… and there are more to come! A new exchange listing has been confirmed for February.The payment gateway will incentivize adoption by featuring a fee structure that is lower than PayPal and credit card processing companies.Live Beta testing is underway right now! You can even go and try the early beta for yourself on the FCF merch store.Every payment gateway transaction will also induce a buy back and BURN mechanism in FCF thereby increasing the value of your FCF by reducing the overall supply!$FCF rewards holders with BNB dividends based on trading volume (5% of each transaction goes to the dividend pool and is distributed proportionally) AND from a portion of transaction fees onceFCFpay is launched. Yes you will earn dividends on every payment gateway transaction! This safeguards your investment from bear markets by establishing a second source of dividend revenue! Imagine receiving a portion of the $4 trillion-dollar e-commerce industry simply by holding FCF!As a great cherry on the cake FCF has launched an NFT collection The FrenchFellas! The collection is based on our spiritual leader Gotto the French Bulldog.The Dev is always active and always OVERDELIVERS.Dev is Doxxed KYCd and a Certik audited!Medium [https//medium.com/@fcf/fcf-pay-january-4th-abd34c2d7ee7](https//medium.com/@fcf/fcf-pay-january-4th-abd34c2d7ee7)The FrenchFellas NFT!

Edac Coin🔥| Revolutionises and achieves something that seemed to be Impossible with an innovative Project Which Tokenizes Mining Power | Being Launched Soon 🚀 |,Bitcoin or Ethereum? Trading or crypto mining? Why not all at once?&#x200B;EDAC Coin is being launched. It is a cryptocurrency that is linked to both Ethereum and Bitcoin which allows to take advantage from the mining activity of Ethereum and obtain returns from it without having the required technical knowledge nor the necessary machinery. &#x200B;On February 1 2022 EDAC has obtained a positive rating from an Auditrate technology auditing firm as well as the proof of vexed team . &#x200B;However the initial offer will start at the end of February. &#x200B;There have been other projects that claimed to be dedicated to cryptocurrency mining but they typically were pyramidal frauds and scams which raised capital by offering unsustainable interest. There are also public companies trading in Stock markets. What distinguishes EDAC and what makes the project unique is that all processes are carried out in a decentralized way in the Ethereum blockchain and through a DAO which will be in charge of deciding the most important strategic and tactical decisions. &#x200B;So at this time EDAC will focus on mining Ethereum cryptocurrencies while watching son this blockchain continues to use proof-of-work technology because it is the most profitable at the moment. But later on it will continue betting on this technology which is the one that guarantees greater decentralization and fair access to all participants. Whether mining bitcoins or any other cryptocurrency based on proof of work mining the operation of the EDAC Project is as follows.&#x200B;EDAC tokens are sold and used to buy hashrate power i.e. through rigs. This power generates mining rewards. The net income (around 50% of all ETH rewards) is used to buyback EDAC coins which will immediately be burnt. This constant demand and decreasing supply should impulse EDAC price to new All-Time Highs.&#x200B;When an ATH is reached (not before thus guarantying a scarcity of supply) up to a 0.5% of token supply can be sold to buy new mining capacity conforming a virtuous circle of returns.  &#x200B;Furthermore 1% of trading volume will be redistributed in bitcoins (wrapped bitcoins) among holders automatically with a transaction fee.  &#x200B;Website  [https//edac.io](https//edac.io)Telegram [https//t.me/edac_io](https//t.me/edac_io)Twitter [https//twitter.com/edactoken](https//twitter.com/edactoken)Contract ERC-20 [https//etherscan.io/token/0x1a1f2e827f9d35fd3b599ac253b33cb6e19ff556](https//etherscan.io/token/0x1a1f2e827f9d35fd3b599ac253b33cb6e19ff556),29,0.94,7,2022-02-04 17:12:56

⚡️ $FCF has booked a PLATINUM booth at the DUBAI crypto expo!| FCFPay Beta Phase is Live - Empowering Crypto 🚀 | 500+ Merchants already signed up for FCFPAY| Certik Audited| A true crypto-to-crypto payment gateway for ecommerce and physical retail stores | Earn Daily dividends on each transaction!, French Connection Finance has booked a PLATINUM booth in the most prestigious crypto expo in the world!FCF representatives will be attending CRYPTO EXPO DUBAI 2022 on March 16-17. They even have a 20-minute on-stage presentation that will broadcast FCF and FCFPAY to the world!Another exchange listing has been confirmed for the 3rd week of February! This will bring huge exposure to the project.REBRANDING is imminent! In order to avoid any confusion whatsoever regarding the fact that FCF is 100% a utility project a new corporate image is about to be revealed. The utility launch marketing plan will also begin in earnest in the days and weeks to come.Over 500 Merchants have already signed up to accept crypto payments for their goods and services through FCFPAY!$FCF is a revolutionary token developing a crypto payment gateway called FCFpay. It integrates with the two biggest e-commerce platforms – WooCommerce & Shopify. But FCFpay doesnt stop there… The flexible API allows it to be integrated into practically any existing payment system even in physical retail stores! In fact a large proportion of the first merchants to use it will be physical stores.Imagine paying directly with crypto! You will soon be able to shop online or in person and spend your crypto gains without having to send them to the bank or use a crypto credit card that is actually just swapping your crypto for fiat. Crypto is about to fulfill its true purpose as the CASH of the internet!FCF Pay will for example allow you to buy flowers with BNB and order food with Cardano (or any other crypto)... just about any combination you can imagine and all without requiring you to use a traditional offramp such as a centralized exchange.This will allow FCF to unite the $4 trillion-dollar online shopping industry with the cryptocurrency world. This unification positions FCF to lead the way towards mass adoption and secures the future of FCF as an essential crypto technology!Thats why their motto is EMPOWERING CRYPTO!$FCF was already listed on 4 exchanges over a period of just 4 weeks! LBANK HOTBIT COINSBIT AND LATOKEN… and there are more to come! A new exchange listing has been confirmed for February.The payment gateway will incentivize adoption by featuring a fee structure that is lower than PayPal and credit card processing companies.Live Beta testing is underway right now! You can even go and try the early beta for yourself on the FCF merch store.Every payment gateway transaction will also induce a buy back and BURN mechanism in FCF thereby increasing the value of your FCF by reducing the overall supply!$FCF rewards holders with BNB dividends based on trading volume (5% of each transaction goes to the dividend pool and is distributed proportionally) AND from a portion of transaction fees onceFCFpay is launched. Yes you will earn dividends on every payment gateway transaction! This safeguards your investment from bear markets by establishing a second source of dividend revenue! Imagine receiving a portion of the $4 trillion-dollar e-commerce industry simply by holding FCF!As a great cherry on the cake FCF has launched an NFT collection The FrenchFellas! The collection is based on our spiritual leader Gotto the French Bulldog.The Dev is always active and always OVERDELIVERS.Dev is Doxxed KYCd and a Certik audited!Medium [https//medium.com/@fcf/fcf-pay-january-4th-abd34c2d7ee7](https//medium.com/@fcf/fcf-pay-january-4th-abd34c2d7ee7)The FrenchFellas NFT!

Meme coin fatigue,I cant be the only one tired of meme coins 🤮. Time to go back to the better days when altcoin speculation was based on fundamentals and countdown clocks. A time when people bought shitcoins in droves when a project announced pretty much anything.  Im more into projects like Strongnode. Its a layer 0 project that allows people to generate passive income by renting out their latent internet-connected devices (phone laptop smart fridge) as nodes that work together in a giant mesh to batch process data. Basically Strongnode mines computational resources and stores them on the blockchain. Any company or crypto project can use these nodes rather than traditional centralized cloud computing options. Using Strongnode is a superior option that will decrease latency for all projects that use their infrastructure. Even console games can use Strongnode.The crypto use cases are endless. Low latency music NFT streaming decentralized high-frequency trading bots MEV on other blockchains  and more is possible. To top it all off since all of the electricity to create the computational resources Strongnode is mining already exists the increase in demand doesnt generate additional electricity. Thus it is technically environmentally friendly. Thats not the case for cloud computing server warehouses.You can find it on Quickswap. Centralized exchange listings are coming in the very near future.[https//quickswap.exchange/#/swap?inputCurrency=0x2791bca1f2de4661ed88a30c99a7a9449aa84174&outputCurrency=0x32934cb16da43fd661116468c1b225fc26cf9a8c](https//quickswap.exchange/#/swap?inputCurrency=0x2791bca1f2de4661ed88a30c99a7a9449aa84174&outputCurrency=0x32934cb16da43fd661116468c1b225fc26cf9a8c),19,1.0,18,2022-01-14 02:11:11
🔋EVDC 🔋- Migration this Friday ( Eth --> Avax)- The future of charging currency - Low Cap Gem,🔋 EVDC is the first token which will be used as ev charging currency&#x200B;MigrationAfter the polls and votes of the community member the team also met and discussed the future blockchain network to migrate EVDC (ERC 20). We have decided to migrate the evdc token(Ethereum pair)on the avalanche network EVDC (Avax C-Chain). EVDC (ERC-20) will migrate to EVDC (Avax C-Chain). The token migration ratio will be 11 and EVDC (ERC-20) holders dont have to do anything during migration. We will airdrop all the holders.&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;EVDC the crypto-based EV charging project is looking to expand its reach and business as it has announced that the company would be selling its Electric Vehicle (EV) chargers from now onwards. These chargers can easily be placed anywhere such as restaurant parking hotels etc. Anyone who buys the chargers would essentially be part of the whole EVDC ecosystem and would not have to handle the marketing end of the business as the application directs EV owners to the nearest charging station itself.&#x200B;✅App launched on iOS/AndroidThe whole ecosystem comprises of the following parts* Charging stations* User Mobile Application* EVDC tokensEV owners would download EVDCs application where they would get easy navigation towards the nearest charging slot hence eliminating all the hassle related to charging. The navigation would be done efficiently through algorithms that gather data from around the neighborhood and display the charging stations on a user-friendly open charge map. The application would also serve to be the interface that would help the users connect to the charging station.

LOFCRYPTO  5% BUYBACK AND BURN IS FOR DIAMOND HAND HODLERS 💎 | SOON MULTI-CHAIN | WEB 3.0 Platform with NFTs from Content Creators in coming | No CENSORSHIP | Long-Term Project,**Discover LOF****On every sell the buyback and burn of 5% is triggered**The LOF liquidity is paired to 70% BUSD and 30% BNB for the price stability. The Buyback and Burn is another feature of the LOF tokenomics that fights back the downswings of the market.The advantage of our buyback and burn system is to increase the value of LOF token by lowering its supply as income increases. This tokenomicss feature increases liquidity and reduce price volatility.&#x200B;Introducing new investors and consumers into our economy is paramount to the success of this project. Retaining them as customers and investors is a core objective we hope the new tokenomics communicate this properly. Entering our ecosystem will have a lower tax than exiting the ecosystem. This rewards long term holders. One of the core changes to the customers will be that any purchases on the marketplace will be tax-free with respect to tokenomics i.e. tokenomics will not apply.Another core objective of LOF is to empower content creators with the tools necessary to make more income. This is something this team holds dear to our heart. Taxing the transactions on Content Creators both coming and going from their personal wallets was contrary to this goal. An ongoing whitelist for all Content Creators going forward guarantees more money in their wallets and incentivizes them to use our platform over most other projects in the crypto field.We are a dedicated professional passionate and creative team and we strongly believe that LOF will become the ultimate adult crypto platform soon. We all have a common vision and will work tirelessly to make it a reality and benefit investors and content creators alike. Our actions will speak louder than the words on this page ever could. The best is yet to come.✅ Fan platform in Final Stages of Developement✅ First of its kind payment solutions for Content Creators✅ NFT Marketplace like NOBODY else has✅ First Farmed NFTs with Utility✅ Team that Consistently COMMUNICATES✅ KYCd Team✅ Multisig Wallets for ALL FUNDS 🔒✅ Buyback + Burn on every sell (Hyper Deflationary)✅ Auto LP Every Trade✅ Rewards in ANY BSC Token💎 Diamond Hand Holders**Come and Join our amazing community!****Telegram ** [https//t.me/Lonelyfanschat](https//t.me/Lonelyfanschat)**Twitter ** [https//twitter.com/LOFcrypto](https//twitter.com/LOFcrypto)**Website ** [https//lofcrypto.com](https//lofcrypto.com/),16,0.95,14,2022-01-27 04:08:24

What Crypto Traders Should Know About DeFi,The terms decentralized finance or DeFi are often used these days particularly if youre interested in bitcoin. But what information do bitcoin investors need to be aware of?1. The DeFi industry is thriving.Parallel to the rising interest in cryptocurrencies the decentralized financial sector has grown from strength to strength. Indeed according to the statistics and rankings website DeFi Pulse there is now roughly $90 billion locked up in DeFi.Total Value Locked (TVL) which reflects the value of cash placed in different DeFi apps is tracked by DeFi Pulse and is a valuable indication of market size. Many DeFi apps (For example CRD Network TenX SwapDEX and Kusari) are based on the Ethereum (ETH) network; hence the price of Ethereum affects both TVL and the amount of money invested in DeFi.TVL was worth approximately $8.5 billion at the end of 2019 and it was expected to be worth around $25 billion by the end of 2020. It will likely exceed $100 billion by the end of this year.2. DeFi does not provide the same level of security as conventional institutions.In standard bank and investment accounts the safeguards that we take for granted in traditional bank and investment accounts may not exist in decentralized finance. It is critical to consider what will happen if anything goes wrong since there may be no safety net.For example if a typical bank collapses your money is protected up to $250000 per qualified account under FDIC insurance. (This excludes brokerage accounts; however they have another kind of insurance known as SIPC.) Most folks dont give it much attention since their bank hasnt failed yet. However there is a greater probability that a decentralized financial network would collapse – and much less safety in place if it does.Here are some more things to think about before diving into DeFiWhere your assets will be stored Look for platforms that keep the bulk of assets offline in what is known as cold storage – and find out whether they have insurance against hacking or other types of crime. Third-party audits and other security measures such as bug bounty programs are beneficial.How your assets will be used Some DeFi platforms claim to pay high-interest rates on the cryptocurrency you deposit. They often do this by lending your cash and giving you a portion of the interest borrowers pay them. Transparency is essential because you want to know who they could lend your money to and how hazardous such loans are.Eliminating the intermediary is that you are replacing an organization with a piece of code. Thats OK if the code is trustworthy but its an issue if it isnt. Look for open source projects which allow anybody to see the code and report flaws. Also be skeptical of new ventures that havent been well tested.Scams By August of this year CipherTrace reported that $471 million had been lost in DeFi fraud and cyberattacks which was much more than in prior years. And once crypto money has been taken it may be challenging to recover. Before putting money into a DeFi program do your homework. Pay close attention to internet evaluations particularly those on crypto forums since they are sometimes the first indications of possible difficulties.3. Regulation is on its wayIncreased crypto and DeFi regulation seems to be more than a possibility; it appears to be an inevitable conclusion. Various agencies ranging from the SEC to the Treasury have emphasized the need for more excellent controls. One source of worry is that DeFi platforms provide bank-like services while not providing the same levels of consumer protection as conventional banks. Another advantage is the ease with which anonymous DeFi services may be utilized to avoid current regulations prohibiting money laundering.4. There are several methods to participate in DeFi.One method to get a piece of the DeFi action is to own DeFi cryptocurrency tokens. The value of such currencies has risen in tandem with the growth of the DeFi sector.DeFi also allows you to earn interest in your cryptocurrencies. We had highlighted borrowing and lending sites which sometimes pay substantially more excellent rates than ordinary savings accounts. Another option is to utilize these platforms to stake your coins which entails tying them up to contribute to the general security and upkeep.If you decide to invest in DeFi like with any other cryptocurrency only invest money you can afford to lose. Also do a thorough study of the sector to grasp the potential dangers completely. Its an exciting new world but its also with little safety nets in place.,12,1.0,17,2022-01-31 16:39:46

These chargers can easily be placed anywhere such as restaurant parking hotels etc. Anyone who buys the chargers would essentially be part of the whole EVDC ecosystem and would not have to handle the marketing end of the business as the application directs EV owners to the nearest charging station itself.✅App launched on iOS/AndroidThe whole ecosystem comprises of the following parts* Charging stations* User Mobile Application* EVDC tokensEV owners would download EVDCs application where they would get easy navigation towards the nearest charging slot hence eliminating all the hassle related to charging. The navigation would be done efficiently through algorithms that gather data from around the neighborhood and display the charging stations on a user-friendly open charge map. The application would also serve to be the interface that would help the users connect to the charging station. To make the whole process easier making membership accounts would not be mandatory for users and all the processes can be done through guest accounts.✅ More than 1000+ positive reviews✅ EVDC DCFC Supercharger roll-out (350KW+) funding is locked.✅Liquidity Locked✅Audit passed✅Founder revealed --> [https//www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXKHCiqSc8o&t=1216s](https//www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXKHCiqSc8o&t=1216s)🔋Token MetricsDeflationary and Decentralized.Support Wallet for Adjustments Less than 1%Ticker Symbol EVDCToken Type BEP20/ERC20Soon there will be some massive news about our funding program.Market Cap  4.5 mCoinmarketcap  [https//coinmarketcap.com/currencies/electric-vehicle-direct-currency/](https//coinmarketcap.com/currencies/electric-vehicle-direct-currency/)Website  [https//evdc.network](https//evdc.network/)Telegram  [https//t.me/evdctokenchat](https//t.me/evdctokenchat)Linktree  [https//linktr.ee/evdc](https//linktr.ee/evdc),13,1.0,8,2022-01-28 18:37:09

Future of buying cannabis with crypto?,   I was walking through some cannabis forums and reading up on the innovation of the cannabis industry and how far it came to become a multi-billion dollar legal industry. Searching through some crypto forums afterwards I saw this post about tangi token. I checked it out and saw that it promotes a new innovative way of buying cannabis. Theres a fun line between mining and farming I guess but it most definitely is a  good time to be alive. Their set goal is to be available as a way of payment in all dispensaries throughout the USA.  While it does look peculiar Im liking the idea of not having to pay it with cash lol. You can check them out on their site [gettangi.com](https//gettangi.com) . Tangi token is a BEP20 Token on Binance Smart Chain.,12,1.0,6,2022-01-17 21:20:20

Every single person laughing at NFTs today will be using them in 10 years,In the crypto space NFTs are undoubtedly the most derided technology. Since the crypto-bro subculture is so irritating I can see why. Some such as the NFT from [Loud crypto records](https//loudcrypto.io/)  are favorites of mine. They have a wonderful group of people in their community.Many people however need to realize that NFTs are a lot more than just jpegs. Technology that has the ability to change a lot of aspects of our digital life has been developed.Let me show you why Im making my argument. An ETH worldwide hackathon took place last week. Over the course of two days 255 distinct NFT-related projects were generated by participants. The following projects have nothing to do with dumb jpegsNo one can censor you on Creativerse a Minecraft server linked to Ethereum where land and buildings are converted into NFTs.You can earn money every time your photo is used on 0xPhotos a stock photography marketplace.A DeFi project known as veNFT pays NFT holders who are ready to bet their tokens in the project.Documents like DocuSign can now use Ethereum Universal Sign-In thanks to ENS-Signature.&#x200B;As I stated before we are at the very beginning phases of a ground-breaking technology becoming widely used. Individuals who invest in this field now will be termed fortunate by the people who ridicule NFTs in ten years.Make sure to keep an open mind when it comes to the situation at hand. Ignore the misinformation you may receive from the uneducated. Youll see a lot more opportunities if you just do your own thing. In less than a decade NFTs will be pervasive in our digital life.It was Twitter user CroissantETH who first sparked my interest on this topic.) One of his threads contained the projects listed above.)A cruel GIF will be sent to the first person who responds bUt I can right-click and save the jpegs!!1! Warning this is a dangerous place.)&#x200B;&#x200B;,10,0.75,15,2022-02-05 20:34:05

Verify Lens is not a gimmick and it will help each and every investor in various ways!Let me introduce you to the ICO of 2021 [r/VerifyToken](https//www.reddit.com/r/VerifyToken/)! Youre probably wondering what makes Verify different than all of these other shilled posts so allow me explain.Cryptocurrency crimes rose by **1000%** in the last year alone! According to the FTC **consumers lost at least 80 million dollars** as a result. Guess who the consumers are…us. And nobody is stepping up to protect ‘us so there is a clear need for what Verify is doing![Verify](https//www.verifytoken.net/) is bringing full transparency to the crypto market. **The utility behind Verify is Verify Lens.** It is a cloud-based dashboard that will gather data on defi projects—new and old—to aid the investor in making a more informed decision. The dashboard is currently under development. We will be using our own APIs to communicate with APIs from multiple sources to answer your typical DYOR questions. On top of that users will be able to check audits and doxxed devs label wallets track wallet movements and get a security rating for any project—and more!

Are you still trading during the market decline?,The old idea making money with money is in the crypto space I guess for 3-4 years already? The idea seems to be catching fire especially when we see a recession.The uncertainty around this inflationary period—and what the Fed will do—has been reflected in the traditional financial markets. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 fell 10% and 16% respectively from their 52-week highs in December 2021. The ongoing crypto sell-off appears very much related to high rates of inflation and general decline.If youre a crypto investor already then you probably have some red stuff in your portfolio. On the other hand you may have some inactive stablecoins that are waiting for the right time. Many of you already know the answer. It is a great time to stake and earn interest while waiting for the right time to sell/buy more crypto! Make sure there are no lock-up periods.On a personal level I see value in cryptocurrency savings accounts since — lets face it — there arent a lot of places to earn a 10%-20% yield on your savings right now. You could achieve that return with a cryptocurrency savings account even with your stablecoins. Many of the best cryptocurrency savings accounts also come with some pretty attractive terms for their accounts. You can try [Midas.Investments](https//midas.investments/) or exchanges like Coinbase and Binance. Diversification here can also be an optimal solution!What is your approach during uncertain market conditions? What platforms do you feel comfortable earning with?,9,0.85,10,2022-01-30 16:31:26
MommyMilkers [$100k mc],IntroMommy $Milkers is a BSC token that is aimed towards providing a crypto community full of like-minded people with one goal in mind Creating a platform for artists to distribute artwork.What is itMommy $Milkers aims to provide an uncensored decentralized platform for artists to create commission and self-mint NFTs that they can sell auction or transfer in the marketplace. In addition $Milkers aims to incentivize artists and NFT owners through using the platform. While $Milkers holders are rewarded through the platform by simply holding through profit-sharing.About the teamOur team is a diverse mix of marketing madmen and technical experts drawn together by our love of big milkers. We have banded together to develop a product and platform with actual utility besides the usual Meme coin.Market cap and Competitive AdvantageThe NFT and NSFW space Is a big industry with the value being estimated to be in the billions. For reference the current NFT space is valued at approximately $10b. In the NSFW NFT space platforms currently are valued at ~$500m total. The key competitive advantage of milkers is the focus on an otherwise ignored space 2D artwork. As other platforms focus on 3D content we plan to corner and carve out our niche in the 2D space. Our key focus is on establishing partnerships or sourcing from prominent artists and to build a platform that caters to them. As the NFT space is rife with controversy over stolen art we want to do things differently by working directly with artists to give them the credit that they deserve.RoadmapPhase 1 Dairy Farm• Development of social media presence (reddit tiktok twitter telegram) through targeted ad campaign as well as organic community growth• Custom VR mascot for advertisement and tiktok campaigns• Planned release of the milkers NFT collection a privately commissioned 2D erotic art collection using unique arts pieces (no stolen content)• Growth target of 1000 holders and ~100k daily volume (Coingecko/CMC in progress)• Development of milk (white) paper explaining long term plans for token as well as development planPhase 2 Mommy Marketplace• Using established $MILKERS branding to create and maintain relationships with large artists and influencers• Growth target of 10000 holders• Developing exclusive partnerships with artist firms in preparation for Mommys marketplace.• To provide a decentralized platform for artists self-mint commissioned art pieces.• Continue branding recognition through an aggressive marketing campaignPhase 3 Milk-verse• Milkfu series• Growth target of 50000 holders• Doja Cat collaboration• Provide utility to the NFTs minted in the marketplace• Interactions with your own NFTs and othersTokenomicsThe Mommy $Milkers contract had 30% of its initial supply burnt on launch It was fairly launched with no presale and ownership was renounced. In addition The liquidity pool is burnt into the contract Which means the $Milkers token is completely rug proof. The tokenomics of $Milkers is simply a 12% tax on each buy & sell transaction. 5% of the tax is allocated towards rewarding holders automatically with BUSD eliminating the core issue with native token reflections (encourages dumping and devalues native currency). 4% is dedicated towards the marketing wallet to ensure the promotion and development of the project. Finally 3% of the tax is deposited into the burnt liquidity pool reducing volatility. Aside from the tokenomics there is an anti-whale mechanic to prevent any single wallet holding a large amount of the total supply. A ‘max wallet is capped at 1% of the total supply.Contract 0x3ebe9333f4240c27b46bed8713c03a2571fdaa12Websitehttps//www.milkersbsc.com/Discorddiscord.gg/aB3URsY3PpTwitterhttps//twitter.com/MommyMilkersBSC/Telegramhttps//t.me/milkersbscsfwReddit/r/MommyMilkersToken/,11,1.0,8,2022-01-26 18:17:44
Crypto is really our next big opportunity. At least in the way I see it., As our technological developments become larger and larger every day it appears that the world around us is developing exponentially fast. We now have decentralized digital currencies that are becoming more widely accepted around the world digital non-fungible tokens that are being sold for tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars metaverses that allow you to work meet or attend pretty much any social gathering from the comfort of your own home and much more!  All of this entails the possibility of making a lot of money! People are becoming MILLIONAIRES as a result of investing in meme currencies or enterprises. All it takes is a little study and the ability to see the potential of some ideas in their early stages. For me recognition of the blockchain BNPL providers is a revelation. Atpay is actually the first one to do it. Embracing this kind of technology into the blockchain is the type of thing you think you dont need but once you have it you cant live without it.  You put money into those ventures and then wait for them to take off which is when you make money. All you have to do now is wait! Keep your calm and dont sell while others are panicking and selling. In the end it will all be worth it.,10,1.0,4,2022-01-26 17:02:45
TVL in DeFi How Important It Really Is, So what is Total Value Locked? What makes a sturdy TVL? What information can we deduce from this indicator? And finally what can you learn from TVL?TVL has become the most commonly used metric utilized for measuring and comparing the growth of Ethereum-based DeFi projects in particular. It refers to the number of assets staked in a specific project or the total amount of underlying supply secured by a project application or protocol operating in the DeFi sphere.To DeFi participants looking for projects to support and invest in this is the metric that shows the overall health of projects individually and in comparison to one another. However one should understand that the value lying in the cumulative amount of tokens locked is only relevant for particular projects. Lets take the custodial crypto-investment platform [Midas.Investments](https//midas.investments/) as an example. Recently the platform has reached its important milestone - $100mln total value locked. As a project focused on providing high-interest rates for users Midas can be viewed through this prism for the spectator to be able to get an accurate representation of the projects growth journey long-term sustainability and massive potential. Therefore the platforms total value locked (TVL) heavily outlines its capacity to ensure the earning opportunities for users and spur the growth of the DeFi ecosystem as a whole. In other cases it can be a skewed metric. For example to compare liquidity providers because it does not take into account how much each unit of locked up token is utilized.,11,1.0,8,2022-01-24 06:07:29

What are your thoughts on Bitcoin Price Analysis?,Last week we said *Bearish technical indicators but bullish divergence paints a hopeful picture for Bitcoin. A successful hold of the $40-42k demand zone is setting up a potential retest of the key $48k level for BTC – which represents both the daily 200 SMA and the weekly 50 SMA.*  Bullish divergences were pointing to a *possible* retest of the $48k level but after failing to break through the local $45k resistance – BTC has retraced to support. Lets see if we can identify S/R levels for the week. Learn more [here](https//blog.midas.investments/bitcoin-weekly-analysis/).,11,1.0,2,2022-01-18 18:53:23

How different is it to earn interest in a bear market case?,The question is addressed to Trevor CEO at Midas.Investments (custodial crypto-investment platform).My bet is that the market will not face a winter like we had before. The core driver of bearish market back then was the constant ETH dump from ICOs without any real economy in crypto. Now we have 7 different blockchains with dozens of new protocols that are funded by the row of VCs and rich individuals which drives technological innovation forward. Tech innovation in crypto goes hand in hand with liquidity and tokenization. So there will always be some ways to generate yield on the front row of innovation. Additionally liquidity transfers from one market to another. From one strong asset to others. Our goal is synch with those market cycles and position ourselves in a way that liquidity flows within crypto. Thats why we build a lot of tools and hire various experts to cover up the whole complexity of the market. I think that DeFi is built on top of yields. If there are yields there is a DeFi. DeFi is the liquidity that solves a problem. p2p lending trading leverage etc. In order to solve the problem for users protocols need liquidity. And the best yield mechanics will attract more liquidity. I love our business model since we are the unique liquidity provider. We are the most loved player on this market. Therefore I do not foresee any problem in the nearest future. We might lower the rates as a response to the asset growth of the platform and risk diversity. The case could be we have too much assets and producing such high yields will lead to extra risks on portfolio. So if this happens we will adapt. And we will adapt to everything. My dream is that your children steadily grew the portfolio on Midas and became financially independent from survival-based decisions when they reach maturity. What a wonderful life they could have.To get all the latest information regarding DeFi and get the most profit out of it feel free to follow this up-to-date Crypto / DeFi discord [channel](https//discord.com/invite/midas).,9,0.86,13,2022-02-07 06:58:21

Im expecting crypto to rise again and this is what Im investing into., Bitcoin has seen a number of new all-time high prices — followed by huge losses — as well as a rise in institutional buy-in from large organizations. Ethereum the second-largest cryptocurrency has also recently risen significantly.  However the industry is still in its infancy and is constantly evolving. Thats one of the reasons why every new high such as Bitcoins is followed by a rapid decline. Im expecting everything to blow up again which is why Im going to put in even more money.  Im absolutely going to purchase some more bitcoin and ethereum but Im also going to invest in a project called PhoenixDao. I think they have a great idea and I think it has a lot of promise. The main reason I chose this project to invest into is because of their dApp. In my opinion it is going to be a great project because it has a really good idea behind it basically through their dApp you can purchase tickets for different kinds of events.    What do you think will be the best thing to invest in?,9,1.0,11,2022-02-02 22:54:37

LOFCRYPTO  With 70% BUSD LP Your Investment in LOF is SAFU ! 👌 | SOON MULTI-CHAIN | WEB 3.0 Platform with NFTs from Content Creators in coming | No CENSORSHIP | Long-Term Project,**Discover LOF**LOF is paired with a stablecoin BUSD that is pegged to fiat currency USD with a 11 ratio. 70% of LOF Liquidity Pool contains BUSD and 30 % contains the non-stable coin BNB.Recently we saw BTC dropping so much and other crypto currencies too. Stablecoins act as a kind of refuge in the highly volatile cryptocurrency market.  With the 70% BUSD LP keep in mind your investment in LOF is SAFU 👌&#x200B;Introducing new investors and consumers into our economy is paramount to the success of this project. Retaining them as customers and investors is a core objective we hope the new tokenomics communicate this properly. Entering our ecosystem will have a lower tax than exiting the ecosystem. This rewards long term holders. One of the core changes to the customers will be that any purchases on the marketplace will be tax-free with respect to tokenomics i.e. tokenomics will not apply.Another core objective of LOF is to empower content creators with the tools necessary to make more income. This is something this team holds dear to our heart. Taxing the transactions on Content Creators both coming and going from their personal wallets was contrary to this goal. An ongoing whitelist for all Content Creators going forward guarantees more money in their wallets and incentivizes them to use our platform over most other projects in the crypto field.We are a dedicated professional passionate and creative team and we strongly believe that LOF will become the ultimate crypto platform soon. We all have a common vision and will work tirelessly to make it a reality and benefit investors and content creators alike. Our actions will speak louder than the words on this page ever could.

SUS how exchanges always go doing during bull markets,  Anyone else notice this? Or do you just not care?Theres always a pattern of exchanges slowing down or going down completely during bull run. Im sick of this excrement and I dont think we should stand for this any longer. This is not fair to the traders and only good for the exchange itself. Thankfully there are markets out there that still provide hope. Decentralization is hope. It gives hope for all of us for liberating ourselves of the proprietary market that has a chokehold on all of us. And thats not fair at all. We need to trade freely especially at time like these when the market goes green and our wallets heavier. Theres a couple of good decentralized ideas that come to mind immediately such as Werewolf a favorite of mine among others. And I think exchanges like these can change the world and the future. Bullish.,24,1.0,0,2022-02-05 07:36:34
DeFiTrading Studio launched a subscription based Trading Desktop App? Finally??,I just saw the latest update on the [https//defitradingcoders.com/](https//defitradingcoders.com/) that I follow for a bit now as they were the first people to launch a sniping bot on BSC back in the day.Now they launched their newest app for Sniping on BSC and soon on AVAX SOL and MATIC that FINALLY uses a desktop GUI image attached and is only 99.99 USD a month. So people can finally buy a legit sniper with license keys from a reputable studio.Here is the link (You can see how the app looks on the page) [https//defitradingcoders.com/product/pancakeswap-sniping-bot/](https//defitradingcoders.com/product/pancakeswap-sniping-bot/)Their youtube channel [https//www.youtube.com/channel/UCLyD7pxHXyo0eg0s45IrveQ](https//www.youtube.com/channel/UCLyD7pxHXyo0eg0s45IrveQ)I think its better than buying 700 bucks sniper from websites that look like my daughter did them in MS paint.I personally use their sniper so any questions let me know.PS Desktop apps are for Windows and Linux MacOS is still in development they said.Peace,22,0.97,3,2022-02-01 22:48:11
Should we be concerned about the use of our funds in the projects where we invest?,I want to make it clear that this is my personal opinion and we need more opinions to reach a conclusion so feel free to express your opinion.  Many times we rush to enter into the pre-sale of any project that catches our attention because imagining the possible profits makes us make the decision to put our investment. But if a project is in full development phase it is not going to use 100% of our funds! What happens with the rest of the capital?  We dont really know they can use it for anything which takes away the investors control of their own funds. I have always disagreed with that.  I met a protocol Escrow Protocol that thinks the same way it is not necessary for projects in full start-up phase to have 100% of the funds and moves the control of the funds to a smart contract that releases funds according to the progress of the project and thus avoids the project having the totality of all the funds. This is what I think as I said from the beginning of this post it is not a recommendation it is an opinion and we need to know more opinions about this that is happening with new development projects. Feel free to give your opinion.,19,1.0,15,2022-01-11 13:58:48

The key to an NFT-based games success.,  There has been a lot of investment in the NFT/Metaverse/P2Espace recently. Many businesses are investing heavily in it and it continues to grow. I recently learned that Saudi Arabia is considering investing $6.4 billion in the Metaverse and Grayscale has dubbed the Metaverse a trillion-dollar revenue opportunity. With all of this going on some developers are turning NFT-based games into cash-grabs taking advantage of the hype surrounding NFT-based games and creating games with no good gameplay or graphics whose sole purpose is to make money.The majority of them are carbon copies of the Axie infinity concept which is a game in which players collect train and battle digital creatures known as Axies each of which has unique attributes that make them more or less valuable.I believe that to have a successful NFT-based game we need to see more qualified and experienced game developers who can create a game that everyone can enjoy first and attract millions of players to invest in collectibles art and other virtual goods on a blockchain-powered gaming platform that runs on reliable technology and provides a seamless gaming experience.Others includeSecurity - Security and the protection of developers and gamers are always the top priorities. For those who are unfamiliar with the blockchain concept it is designed to be secure. This is always the case and the implementation and settings have a huge impact on it.Transparency - In-game purchases are frequently one-time non-transferable investments tied to a specific gaming environment. Gamers can claim ownership of their in-game assets by using the NFT game platform settings. Gamers can use blockchain technology to save in-game purchases sell them to other players and transfer them to other compatible games.Standardization - By expressing non-fungible assets on public blockchains developers can create common reusable and inheritable standards. Ownership transfer and necessary access control are all standard primitives.Immutability - When a typical online game goes down users frequently lose all of their in-game purchases. On the other hand the NFT game website is built on the blockchain and is not tied to any specific gaming platform.Unfortunately only free games including Monster Galaxy follow this model. A creature taming and combat game backed by 18 years of experience team in the global online anime community and gaming industryMonster Galaxy P2E is owned by Gaia Club which has released several successful games including zOMG and Lake Kindred. The Monster galaxy music Monster Galaxy P2E also shines bright thanks to a stunning soundtrack from Jeremy Soule and the band TREAT. And players will also enjoy an enhanced battle experience and also earn while they play thanks to an exciting new token-based economy!Other benefits are Players As Owners Total Transparency Free Exchange Economic Returns. Players can earn these in-game tokens and MOGA NFTs by completing quests as well as battling monsters and fellow players and also stake their GGM token on the staking site.Is it likely that more projects will follow the proper gaming model or will the cash-grabs craze continue?,17,1.0,21,2022-02-07 20:00:41
My point of view on the crypto market. Do you agree?, I would really like to understand how the brains of some people on the crypto market are working.I dont understand how those FUD people lose faith in a matter of days. A few days ago they bought BTC at 45K and were happy about it and today they are selling because all the crypto is gonna disappear.  Tomorrow they will buy it again on 45K and cry on Twitter and Reddit how they lost half of their money because the crypto market isnt stable. If I learned one thing from the years in crypto it is that I was only regretted selling in a bear market never for buying in the bull market because all the bull prices are ridiculous after a couple of years or even months. Now I am just buying solid coins from projects with strong narratives and big potential like NGM from the E-money or Ocean from the OceanProtocol project. I buy it put it in my wallet mark my selling price and forget about it until its price reaches the point.,16,1.0,48,2022-01-24 09:26:58
The success and failures of new NFT projects,Every other day there is a new NFT project in the market so what really determines its rate of success or failure? Is it pure luck or just a cash cow being milked to oblivion?Im a bit far from the NFT scene so I have to say Im genuinely asking these questions with honest curiosity what should I look for in a successful NFT project? Is it just innovation or being different from the market?The other day one of my friends told me about this new up-and-coming crypto NFT project Royal Falcons Club and their concept of rarities and unique rewards seems interesting and innovative but is that all there is to success in the NFT space?,14,1.0,13,2022-01-12 20:16:03
Is utility tokens the way of the future and what are some promising projects?,Utility tokens differ from other cryptocurrencies in that they cannot be mined and rely on the existing blockchain. The widely recognised ERC and TRC token standards are the most widely used for creating utility tokens. Many crypto startups prefer ERC20 and TRC20 for utility token development because they are built on popular networks like Ethereum and Tron. However there are a number of other tokens that can be beneficial when invested in. They are as followsBinance USD Chainlink or UniswapOnly if the token issuer/owner is listed on a crypto exchange is a utility token valid. The utility tokens value will be determined only after it has been listed. The token will be worthless until then.In the utility token sale there have been numerous scams. As a result exercise caution when investing in utility tokens.A common misunderstanding is that as more people use utility tokens the value of the token will rise. When demand for utility tokens outnumbers supply the value of the tokens rises.As adoption grows people are gravitating toward cause-based projects which we can refer to as utility-based tokens in the crypto world. One such project to keep an eye on is Bob Eco Coin which is the first of its kind in the ev sector. Its the worlds first tokenization of a for-profit social enterprise. Bobcoin is a type of security token that is backed by both equity and assets.,12,1.0,23,2022-02-05 10:56:15

Crowdfunding Challenges and how to solve them.,Not all crowdfunding campaigns succeed. Statistically speaking less than 40% of crowdfunding campaigns succeed whereas more than 60% fail. Of the 60% that fail many are scams or otherwise ill-conceived projects that promised more than what could be realistically delivered. For the 40% which succeed studies have shown that a good number of them eventually end up failing. Entire crowdfunding platforms have eventually collapsed when they failed to deliver the collected funds to the creators themselves even when they were fully prepared to deliver to their backers on their promises. Some good examples include PledgeMusic and Krowdpop. In such cases whether the result of fraud or overambition one thing is certain the backers money is lost. The challenge is usually one of accountability. There must be a way to ensure that the crowdfund creators are accountable to the backers. Protocols like Escrow Protocol solve this it is a decentralized trust fund that combines traditional crowdfunding with Blockchain technology. Crowdfunding creators can create one for their projects seeking funding and lay out milestones and timelines according to their actual capacity to achieve these milestones. The backers funds are released in installments to the creator at every milestone. There is also a possibility of staking these funds with an APY yield of about 12 – 15 %. This way the accountability problem is solved and backers have oversight over their contributions.  ,11,0.99,21,2022-01-13 05:34:17

What is your favorite stablecoin? I need to use them and with the amount of FUD surrounding Tether. Id rather not touch it.,I need to use stablecoins for my day to day and to keep my funds safe. I have many reasons for doing this the main one being the fact that I just refuse to use any banks in my country and the banking system as a whole. Obviously USDT is frankly not an option for me just too much FUD.Ive looked into $EURST and it seems like an incredible choice Im frankly most probably going to be using it but I thought Id post on the sub and ask around for everyones stablecoin of choice. As far as security and transparency is concerned. Thanks a lot in advance boys.,10,1.0,14,2022-02-09 18:55:51
The El Salvador government has told IMF to mind their business concerning Bitcoin,Can I say that I am proud that governments are now telling these International organizations to mind their business and leave them alone? It gives me joy especially when I see developing countries doing this. The government of El Salvador on Monday rejected a recommendation by the International Monetary Fund to drop Bitcoin as legal tender in the Central American country. Imagine wanting the country to stop using Bitcoin as its legal tender. A sovereign country. The same way those international organizations claimed crypto and crypto trading activities on the likes of Binance and Tycoon.io were a fad. But today tells a different tale. Treasury Minister Alejandro Zelaya noted angrily no international organization is going to make us do anything anything at all.,9,1.0,2,2022-02-01 15:15:32

NFTs and The Crypto Realms Seem To Be Different From Each Other,For the past few weeks the crypto space has not tasted the joy of the bull market. The market has been annoying. Some coins are doing well but many aint. The major coins have refused to reach their previous ATH or even smash them. This is annoying. While we suffer in the crypto market the NFT space seems to be having a time of its life. I keep seeing millions of dollars flying around in NFT sales. At this point I think I am going to try out NFTs. Maybe I should just mint Anime NFTs from Goku. I will do that. I want a slice of the cake from the NFT space.,9,1.0,23,2022-01-17 12:20:56
The actual income value of staking,Everywhere I look staking is the most boring and slow brewing endeavor I could find. Which is strange because in the Fiat world its a big thing for people especially those with bag bank accounts. Dont get me wrong I want to stake I just often find it strange and useless in this kind of market. Everyone who stakes it seems is too lazy to trade. This is unfortunate but it seems to be the case of the matter. Which is honestly pretty bad because as I stated above staking does carrying real value and can be enjoyable. I find some exchanges found a way already to improve this. Like the work Werwolf exchange is putting in to make staking under different sub-categories and classes moons and unique rewards. These are the kinds of exciting ideas that got the market started in the first place and these are the ones that are begging to return.Staking should not be as lame as it is currently. Other exchanges have to do a better job at this.,8,0.91,25,2022-02-08 10:43:25
I think we could really see play-to-earn and gaming take the blockchain by storm. Its just going to take a little bit of work the potential feels limitless.,Blockchain gaming in my opinion is one of the most promising applications of the blockchain technology. I mean this business is making significant contributions to the world but the gaming industry is undoubtedly the most promising. Decentralized gaming offers a number of incentives for both players and creators. And in fact this is one of the key reasons why this sector of the blockchain business will be one of the most successful.And platforms such as ENGN are aiming to make it easier for programmers to do their jobs by allowing them to connect their data to blockchain-compatible data. So someday the game industrys future will be good; were still in the early stages.,9,1.0,17,2022-02-03 18:37:23

The entry level for games like Axie Infinity is too high and its a problem.,The main problem being that its not welcoming to new players from outside of the NFT gaming scene.Especially considering that Axie Infinity is one of the most popular NFT games some gamers would feel bummed knowing they cant enter the NFT gaming scene cause of this high entry level.And while there are in fact projects like Dreem that can immensely decrease the entry level to games like Axie not all new player are familiar with such projects and end up simply not playing NFT games.If we want mass adoption of NFT games we either need to work increasing awareness for projects like Dreem or full on find a complete solution to high entry levels.,8,1.0,19,2022-01-26 22:12:33

The threat of quantum computers is no longer a mirage but it is becoming more intense.,  In the crypto space 2021 was a year we will never forget; hopefully the damage done during this time did not wipe us all out but what is to come may be bigger than anything we have ever seen.According to a [Check Point](https//blog.checkpoint.com/2021/05/12/the-new-ransomware-threat-triple-extortion/) study ransomware attacks increased by 102 percent in the first half of 2021 compared to the first half of 2020 which is very concerning and causes a lot of distress among crypto enthusiasts and even the world as a whole for those who were affected. Regardless global cybercrime costs are expected to rise by at least 15% year on year over the next five years reaching an estimated $10.5 trillion per year by 2025.According to Interesting Engineering cyber-attacks are more likely than missiles to bring down F-35 jets – a startling fact. Recent cybersecurity reports have revealed that cybercriminals are improving their skills and branching out into new territories.For example the first case of cybercrime resulting in death was recorded in September 2020 when a ransomware attack caused IT failure at a hospital in Dusseldorf Germany.The case sparked a frenzy in the healthcare industry with costs to protect themselves from cyberattacks expected to exceed $125 billion by 2025. [https//cybersecurityventures.com/healthcare-industry-to-spend-125-billion-on-cybersecurity-from-2020-to-2025/](https//cybersecurityventures.com/healthcare-industry-to-spend-125-billion-on-cybersecurity-from-2020-to-2025/)As a result the Quantum computer threat has also arisen and even the United States House Committee on Financial Services has recognized this threat. https//www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oOTvtupND8&t=14194sNow research has shown that the cryptography that we thought was all safe and secure will no longer be because IBM announced the release of a 1121+ qubit quantum computer that will break the cryptography behind 99 percent of todays blockchain platforms. https//research.ibm.com/blog/ibm-quantum-roadmapThats concerning isnt it? I sat down to consider what if all of the claims are true what if what we call a fud today becomes a fact and reality next year what if crypto was hacked for good this time and all of my life savings were erased and I awoke early in the morning to CNN news telling me crypto is no longer.Last year I was concerned about all that which prompted me to conduct research.There must always be a counterfeit for every every plan.So I looked to see if there was any blockchain in the world that claimed to be quantum resistant.So with the exception of Qanplatform I discovered none. Qanplatform?Yes it is a quantum resistant layer 1 blockchain and its blockchains are purposefully designed to be resistant to quantum hacking. After seeing this I believe there is hope for crypto once more.Then I dig deeper to find out what else this project has going for it because it could be that one project that takes me 100x.So yes it has several other features as well. It has launched the librescan the first decentralized blockchcian explorer. [https//medium.com/qanplatform/qanplatform-announces-librescan-the-first-decentralized-blockchain-explorer-84cce6913fb](https//medium.com/qanplatform/qanplatform-announces-librescan-the-first-decentralized-blockchain-explorer-84cce6913fb)Developers will be able to build on the Qanplatform chain in any programming language and they have also created a new Multi-language smart contract mechanism.QANplatforms QVM will allow developers to run any application that can run a Linux kernel. There is more to it; it employs the PoR protocol which allows its ecosystem to be green implying that users will be able to mine Qanx once the mainnet is operational. You might as well want to take a deep dive into it so please read through this whitepaper and let me know if you know of any other projects that provide the same quantum resistant security as Qanplatform.

The market is competitive because of competitive people,  People by nature are well very competitive. This is why literally every sport was created we always want to one-up our fellow man. And this is why we have so many advancements in tech and science because of literal competition between people and creators. Not only has this existed since ever. But it has found its way to the market and the crypto markets people want to battle it out with bears and bulls and see who will make it out. This competitive spirit is why I am hopeful on game NFT technology. It literally makes use of all this competition and puts it on a monetizing platform. Games like Axie and Kitty Kart could rule the markets soon enough and this has me very bullish.,7,1.0,3,2022-01-24 09:20:38

The reason people keep failing in crypto is because they keep chasing the top, Most people who invest have literally no idea what theyre doing. To them its like roulette when you make it you have no idea why and neither do they when they fail at it. Thats because they chase hype pumps and tops instead of projects ideas and prospects. Be different. Yes I know how cliché that sounds. Its only redundant because its true. Do not chase top and peaks go after new ideas and projects. Ideas that revolutionize the market and make differences ideas like the Royal Falcons Club with their one-off reward system based on rarity traits at random. Ideas with some NFT projects that secure citation and ownership. Ideas that are new and different…You are not a herd animal. So stop acting like one and think for yourself for a change.,8,0.78,16,2022-01-17 21:29:50

Crypto credit cards hold a lot of value to the crypto market for one reason... Exposure.,This concept is still rather new to the market yet were already starting to see many wallets the likes of Binance and Coinbase releasing crypto credit cars.I already tired them and theyre actually very handy. I got mine from Baanx and aside from the fact that these credit cards offer crypto cash back I also realized that they offer a lot of exposure for the crypto market. That alone should be an incentive for us to switch to crypto credit cards.Once people and businesses start getting used to crypto being involved in payments (even if not directly) it would make them more familiar with it and more accepting of the idea of full on crypto payments later on in the future.,5,0.86,4,2022-01-25 23:39:41

People calling crypto a scam dont realize the opportunities theyre receiving. Crypto is shaping the future. Literally.,I cant see it in a different way. The cryptoverse is not only about coins and tokens being invested in held and traded after a while. Its literally getting bigger everyday and everyone is getting huge opportunities in this space. Its not only an opportunity to make money but its a revolution targeting numerous industries and fields. I mean the gaming industry for example has been hit by crypto and with the arrival of the metaverse were about to see huge differences as well especially  with games like Decentraland and PizzaBucks. Also the NFT space is something that will have huge impact the next few years and will be proving its importance within time.Everything about the cryptocurrency space is growing and the opportunities were getting here are literally becoming bigger. This is only the beginning.,6,1.0,3,2022-01-25 15:32:26
Redditors would you play a blockchain game for the sake of playing or for the sake of making money?,The boom of nft games on the blockchain has brought big gains but also big losses and one of those is due to the extreme economic bleeding that these same nft games suffer.People enter only in order to earn money and not to play. To top it off most of these games are just click-to-earn they do not require any kind of skill so there is no real reward for the player.Thats why the games bleed out so quickly and the losses are so great. Finally to kill these games the games themselves do not generate re-investment and this just pulverizes the internal economy of the game.Now comes the opinion Im looking for as this is an opinion post Id like to know what the most knowledgeable people on Reddit think.Do you think a triple A title on the blockchain that encourages playing and skill before making money could solve this economic issue?Decentralized blockchain technology development groups such as DIG are making the case for converting triple A titles to blockchain gaming and its entire world.Do you see it possible?,7,1.0,9,2022-01-22 11:49:52
Bullish on Sports tokens and fan tokens alike,  Fan tokens sold off the damn shelves. PSG sold so well they were able to improve many aspects of the actual team itself.

Crypto is changing a lot of industries and gaming has been one of the first fields to adopt cryptocurrency.,I mean gaming has always been one of the spaces that tried to benefit from the cryptocurrency and actually this relation was beneficial for both markets. So I believe gaming and crypto will be rising together. And now the arrival of the metaverse is going to add a lot to the gaming industry. Especially with games like Decentraland Sandbox and Pizabucks. The audience is growing and people are now understanding the importance of crypto and what this revolution is capable of doing.The next generation of games is going to be heavily impacted by crypto and the metaverse and we as investors and players got nothing to do but to enjoy and benefit from these advancements.,5,0.78,20,2022-01-19 15:21:28
There are many reasons for everyone to adopt the blockchain technology. The technology behind the blockchain platforms is just giving them a huge advantage on their competitors.,I mean its easy to notice the quality of the services the blockchain technology is delivering. I mean these platforms are being so strong in terms of security and efficiency and theyre earning a lot of recognition these days.These days blockchain platforms are targeting literally everyone. I mean its not a matter of programmers of investors anymore. For example Suku is a blockchain platform thats allowing brands and their clients to connect directly allowing the customers to make sure of the authenticity of their orders and to track them.This is a simple example of  what these platforms are offering to their users. And this is only the beginning once these platforms peak and reach their momentum we wont be settling for less quality.,7,1.0,13,2022-01-17 18:12:50

Crytpocurrency blockchain technology the metaverse and everything in between are giving us plenty of opportunities that were not going to afford on missing them.,I mean its something that we should be discussing missing on the the potential that crypto and everything it is bringing to the world is literally not going to be affordable by any of us. Seriously now this is the new shape of the world the next era starts now especially the metaverse-related projects. I mean the entire crypto sphere is still in the growing process bur projects like Mana or Theta or even Pizzabucks are among the ones that have huge potential to fulfill and one should always stay close of these ones in order to make the best out of this opportunity.So if anyone is sleeping on what this space is going to offer then theyll be missing huge chances to be honest and I dont know if missing such opportunities is affordable at the moments.,5,1.0,10,2022-01-26 16:17:34

Diamond hands get diamond bags,I cant count how many trades I let go of way too soonand ended up missing out on major peaks in price action. I am not the most daredevil out there and Im no gambler when it comes to invsting. I take risks but just enough to fit my risk-reward and never too much. The fact of the matter is I had some paperhands in 2020 and I lost too many chances because of my loose grip. So learn from my mistakes lol if you believe in a project hold on to it until the f*cking end. Dont let people on Reddit or Twitter interfere with your choice hold on to that asset until you hit the moon head-first. Thankfully I feel like I learned from my own mistakes and now for example I have a solid bag of some Royal Falcons Club and Im not letting go until I hit a mil. Diamond hands are a real thing grab on to that coin you want and never let go.,5,1.0,9,2022-01-25 07:54:32

While some people are aware that coins are harmful to the environment there are a few projects that are working to help the environment mend.,While Ethereums transition to a proof-of-stake mechanism will take time there are good alternatives to look forward to in terms of energy consumption such as XRP. And cardano unlike other cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin uses the Ouroboros proof-of-stake system. Users must purchase tokens to join the network which saves a significant amount of energy.These are some of the well-known coins; new projects are launched almost every month and I recently came across a coin called Bob Coin that is promoting sustainable change through the use of electric bikes and reducing unemployment in Africa.,5,0.86,15,2022-01-18 16:22:19
Do we really give a damn what governments and officials have to say about crypto? They clearly dont have our best interest in mind.,Some governments continue to skirt the issue attempting to deny the fact that crypto adoption is unavoidable and it will only be a matter of time before everyone is aware of the benefits of adopting digital currency. Bankers argue that cryptocurrencies are too volatile to be integrated into existing financial systems but what about stablecoins like $USDT $USDC $EURST $BUSD...Stablecoins are the ideal substitute for fiat currencies since they provide price stability as well as the benefits of utilizing crypto for online and cross-border payments.,6,1.0,16,2022-01-12 18:25:51
Key In How NFTs Are the Fad Thatll Define The Future, **Seriously What Are NFTS?**The thing about NFTs that is spoken too little is the fact they are keys. ‘To what? you might ask. To *anything*. NFT utility as long as the contract hasnt been coded by a complete numpty can be completely backended as the metaworlds that accommodate them are built out on the blockchain. The code that comes with your grinning perfect ape can ultimately be used as registration (secure as any private key held in crypto) for anything that the person requiring it wants.   The NFT market is currently valued at $7 billion according to JP Morgan. Never before not even with Bitcoin were so many analysts calling it a bubble. Everyone is waiting for the story to end and the market to crash and the rich to win again. Yet right now the NFT market is churning out winners and the show is going on. With the rise of the metaverse and the NFT tokens that will open their doors the bubble might be more resistant than detractors think. We are all ultimately apes caught in the crossfire of a gas war our meagre sentiment gushed into one little jpeg for the hope and meaning it provides — and the future it will unlock.   What you guys think?   [More](https//medium.com/onomy-protocol/key-in-how-nfts-are-the-fad-thatll-define-the-future-7f4fdc91afd2),5,0.86,16,2022-01-12 13:55:29
The Importance of subreddits like this for new investors,The value of these subreddits to the market cannot be overstated. It is on reddit where the whole cryptocurrency market was pushed into public view in the first place and it is here where new users find info about new coins. I bought my first coin (yes it was DOGE okay) because someone brought it up on reddit as a joke and DOGE made me very wealthy. Yeah I blew most of that away but I was wealthy for a short amount of time. Someone here mentioned a new memecoin Kitty Inu and I will buy in and hope for the best. I made a lot of money from memecoins and Im not stopping now lol.My point is these subreddits are vital to the market and this is just the beginning. When crypto becomes the daily driver of future economies the value of these subreddits will blow out of proportion. Im thankful for subs like this one that can teach the most experienced veteran and the new beginners alike. We often take it for granted the value they provide.,5,0.86,6,2022-01-11 09:22:28
Everyday a new celebrity comes out with a new NFT,And every day I get cringed out. We all know theyre not here for the tech or the market or the cultural change involved. We all know theyre here to seep on the top of the trickle-down overcrowded market and set their claim take their bags and walk away. Its honestly pathetic and we should not have to put up with this. Being as someone who started trading early I saw a lot of positive change and believe you me this is not one of them... None of those celebrities care about crypto or the msrket. Yes that includes the likes of Eric Andre and his peers. Their entry into the market is so dumb and meaningless I see no use in this at all. If they really want to shill their ugly NFTs and take their stupid rewards then they should do it on their own platform targeted at the people who are looking for something like this not on the world stage. Ive seen some platforms like Yunometa offer them a chance at that and that should be where they head. Not here. Im literally getting second-hand embarrassment from this... ,4,1.0,2,2022-02-09 14:45:30

While many people support meme-based coins that serve no purpose and harm the environment there are a few social projects that we should support more.,We may see crypto coins dedicated to philanthropic causes as well as DAO-led projects for social and cultural causes as cryptocurrency adoption grows.Currently on the lookout for projects that go beyond transactional and branch out into fields like finance management and even EVs. Every industry is picking up speed as a result of the current trend and new players have entered the market. There are few undervalued projects that I believe will gain traction and yield significant profits.Some cryptocurrency projects profit at the expense of the environment and society in the real world. Everyone is attempting to transform the metaverse. Its past time to consider efficient alternatives like Pancakeswap ADA algo.Im following a few underappreciated projects. I bought Solana and Algo at the beginning and am now reaping the benefits. Currently people are looking at crypto for different reasons such as bob eco coin which is the worlds first tokenization of a for-profit social enterprise.,3,0.64,25,2022-02-05 11:05:06
Lets say you make a million on an exchange…,You invested 5k in some new coin you wake up months later check it and see its made you your first million. What are the instant next steps you take?Do you immediately sell it? If so imagine the fees to withdraw it. Imagine the tax nightmare its going to be. And when the exchange fees and the tax man take their cut will there even be much left?What would you do?,4,1.0,1,2022-02-04 21:29:23
I can agree that achieving mass adoption for cryptocurrency is not going to be an easy task to fulfill thats for sure but its actually going to happen sooner or later.,I mean we all talk about mass adoption as if it was a simple thing to happen. Its not but for sure weve got a lot of things pushing crypto forward and bringing more people towards this space. One of these factors is the attempts to simplify crypto and bringing it closer to the peoples understanding like issuing crypto cards for example. Weve got plenty of platforms issuing those such as Crypto.com or Baanx for example.However were yet to reach mass adoption and were still early. There still is a lot of people that dont even know about crypto and these are the ones that we need them to get involved in this market. Once we get to increase the number of individuals interested in cryptocurrency then we can start talking about mass adoption. Also in order to achieve this mass adoption we need companies to start getting into crypto as well so its not only a process of individuals we need to bring huge institutions into this scene. So yeah the process is long and not easy to access but its a matter of time to be honest and its surely going to happen.,3,0.81,4,2022-02-02 13:17:38
I think that now is the time when blockchain space is heading towards success especially which startups are starting to tackle topics thatll benefit the entire business market.,Honestly a challenge that was always facing the blockchain space is the fact that these projects will always find a way to be able to continue in the market and for that they needed a real use case. This is why blockchin startups are now trying to tackle real-life markets just like Suku for example which is aiming to rebuild the supply chain for businesses. I think that the fact that these startups are starting to change the way they look into the market will give this whole space an opportunity to grow. I believe that we will be seeing the whole blockchain technology industry moving into another level from now on.Whats your opinion about that guys? Do you agree to that?,4,1.0,3,2022-01-31 21:00:42

Visas Bitcoin and crypto cards carried out $2.5 billion worth of transactions in Q1 2022.,The demand and usage of crypto is massive. People are stockpiling on their crypto holdings using them to trade copying trading strategies from Tycoon.io for the new traders or even using them for transactions. Any time I remember those traditional finance guys that claimed crypto was a fad that will wither and die I smile. Crypto is here to stay and the earlier that people accept it and try to position themselves in the crypto space the better for them. Some people are collecting their salary through crypto. Some are getting employed in different positions  in the crypto space. The opportunities are numerous.,4,0.84,4,2022-01-31 13:33:30
How the hell are people not afraid of Tether and the fact that they are hiding so much? This completely baffles me.,I think everyone at this point knows that Tether just cannot be trusted.

This makes absolutely no sense to me.Ive switched to $EURST as my stablecoin of choice long ago but I see people continue to use Tether knowing fully well that it could blow up in their face.

Crypto Culture Rock and the Art of Porn, When I think about culture I think sex drugs and rock and roll. Given that bitcoin found its first true use as a medium of exchange on popular (now-defunct) darknet market Silk Road and the explosion of interest in music-geared NFTs and crypto brands its safe to say crypto is becoming a cultural force.Last summer when OnlyFans decided to boot sex workers off its platform (basically used for holding *intimate* meetings between creators and fans) many made the call for the adult industry to embrace cryptocurrency. The site which at the time and is currently filled entirely with bespoke porn almost killed that business line at the behest of banks. At the last second OnlyFans reversed course.The situation revealed how clearly crypto could benefit the adult industry. Cryptos technological innovation is pretty simple when it comes down to it distributed digital tools are difficult to censor or stop. For an industry thats routinely under fire by socially conservative moralists having a little resilience to censorship could help.New crypto projects like Splash are emerging to help out drive change in the industry. Besides wanting to be a major name in the adult industry 3% of each transaction is redistributed amongst all SPLASH holders providing an incentive to hold tokens and earn passive rewards with ease. The Splash pot receives this 2% fee which is distributed bi-weekly to all those diamond hands SPLASH holders to enjoy. If Splash hits the jackpot it can be in for a huge run!,4,1.0,7,2022-01-31 12:44:47

Fans deserve more of the sport,  When I watch a sport for example Formula 1 I am often not satisfied enough with the content I am receiving. Yes I understand this is all part of human greed but man do I require more. If there were projects that provided fans with more and access it would be grand. Projects for example like F11 with their elevation of football watching.

These dips are going to happen but crypto will always find a way back. Dont forget this is still the youngest financial market.,I mean its really bad to criticize crypto like that. Yes those dips are stressful but we will be bouncing back for sure. Crypto is still so young and were early. And the entire market is improving year after year. So just wait for it and dont stress out.One of the reasons that will make you sure that crypto is going to make a comeback and recover is the fact that cryptocurrencies are still being used as payment currencies at least stablecoins and patforms like Binance and CoinOvy are still seeing high numbers of users paying with their cryptocurrencies.

Introduce Your Kids To NFT and Its Functionality Via Anime NFTS,Lets be frank NFTs are not going anywhere. China is creating a law to legalize NFTs that will be different from its crypto laws. Some government authorities are releasing NFTs for different reasons. Brands are using Nfts for different reasons. Some decentralized finance platforms are creating use cases for Nfts like NFT collateralized loans. Very soon people will be able to borrow funds and use these unique tokens as their collateral. Young kids are making money from NFTs. It wont be a bad idea to introduce your kids to it at an early stage. It will give them the head start amongst their peers. A great way to introduce them is to use NFTs that are related to what they use. For instance you could mint Anime NFTs from Goku for your kids especially if they like Anime movies.,3,0.81,17,2022-01-15 13:14:44
Samsung and cardano partnering up, At the 2022 Consumer Electronics Show Samsung announced its partnership with Veritree to plant 2 million mangrove trees. The trees are planted in the Mahajanga region of Madagascar. The coastal area suffers from biodiversity problems due to widespread deforestation. Last year Samsung saw significant steps in adopting blockchain technology. They launched a native blockchain wallet for their Samsung Galaxy phones. The wallet would make it possible to trade and store cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin Ethereum ERC tokens and TRC tokens. Samsung also announced that it will release three smart televisions that support NFT integrations.The Cardano blockchain has long been known as one of the most energy-efficient blockchain networks. According to some estimates the proof-of-stake protocol consumes only 6 GWh of energy per year across the entire network. With its already low carbon footprint the blockchain is still striving to become carbon neutral in the long term. Hence their partnership with Veritree. The long-term goal is for Cardano to become the greenest blockchain network according to the Cardano Foundation. I recently came a long Atpay and Earth2.

The easiest way to avoid Crypto Scams ,In the last two years there has been a surge in the number of Crypto scams and this has been majorly attributed to the little or no regulation of the crypto ecosystem. As of today there are four major crypto scams a crypto investor can encounter in the crypto ecosystem. They include Ponzi Schemes pump and dump schemes fake exchanges and fake apps. Over the next couple of paragraphs we will be defining them and ultimately highlighting how to avoid them. Crypto Ponzi Schemes Ponzi scams generally trick victims into investing in an essentially nonexistent project. Fake apps and exchanges another way that investors get scammed is by developing fake apps and non-existent exchanges. When these apps are downloaded they give the scammers access to the victims private data like funicular information. Pump and dump schemes Here scammers encourage investors to buy crypto assets in dubious crypto projects based on false information. The price of the cryptocurrency subsequently rises and the scammer sells his own shares earning a handsome profit and leaving the victim with worthless coins.Fake celebrity endorsements in this scam celebrity social media handles are hacked or faked. The scammers the use these accounts to post good reviews about fake cryptocurrencies. The easy way to avoid the aforementioned scams is to leverage of vetting crypto platforms like the RiseUp ecosystem. These platforms leverage on technology to get smart contracts crypto holders etc. Some of them also offer research insight to the investments enabling the investors to be well educated and informed about the true nature of crypto projects. ,2,0.67,1,2022-02-09 14:37:36

NFTs are more than just a JPEG.,I do agree that these jpegs are the ones that brought NFTs into the mainstream status especially in pop culture.There are already so many celebrities purchasing and posting NFTs on Instagram and Twitter.However theres more to it than simply purchasing a photo.

This is not a new topic but honestly if we can just replace all these long banking processes with a new method that simplifies all the work then why not?This is why I think that the usage of stablecoins for this kind of payments is going to be more mainstream now. I mean crypto stablecoins likes USDC or EURST can actually be playing a very reliable role in this situation as theyre much easier to transfer from an account to another. I think that stablecoins will be the go-to cross-border payment assets what do you guys think?,3,1.0,9,2022-02-03 12:58:43

Around El Salvador in 45 days A travel story with only Bitcoin,Here are some travel tips from a couple who traveled around El Salvador for 45 days using only Bitcoin.El Salvador adopted Bitcoin ( BTC ) as legal tender more than four months ago on September 7 2021. Bitcoiners around the world have been watching closely as El Salvadors President Nayib Bukele attempts to convert to an entire nation.The president regularly buys every drop has promised a low-tax Bitcoin citadel in the form of Bitcoin City  and is exploring mining BTC with renewable energy using volcanoes.But what is the day-to-day life of those who live in the smallest country in Central America known as the land of volcanoes? Moreover what is it like to try to live only on Bitcoin?An Italian couple Rikki and Laura have succeeded. Rikki is a Bitcoin podcaster and human rights activist active in the space since 2016. Laura works as a community manager in the blockchain space and has been focused on crypto since 2019.After the approval of the Bitcoin Law Laura had the idea of ​​traveling throughout El Salvador for 45 days. The challenge? Live only with Bitcoin. No bartering no euros and of course no US dollars.Their experiences offer a fascinating insight into the countrys history its enchanting landscapes and of course its future with Bitcoin. His travel accounts can be read in English and Italian and his podcast is called *Bitcoin Italy Podcast* .On the other hand Rikki and Laura have also encountered significant challenges from just using BTC such as gaps in education and difficulties transacting with Bitcoin. On January 24 they spoke with Cointelegraph via video call from Santa Ana a coffee-rich region of El Salvador.They are now authentic sources of knowledge for bitcoiners who want to try a BTC-only trip to El Salvador. Here are his top tips for crypto enthusiasts traveling to the small tropical nation.**Do you accept Bitcoin? No? Bye!**In San Salvador many places accept Bitcoin from McDonalds to Starbucks to mom-and-pop stores. In El Zonte known as Bitcoin Beach the birthplace of the Bitcoin Law most vendors advertise that they accept BTC. However off the beaten track Bitcoin is little known and is sometimes confused with the state-sponsored wallet Chivo Wallet .When faced with a seller who does not accept Bitcoin the pairs main advice is to conduct a theatrical experiment. The customer must ask the seller if they accept Bitcoin and if the seller says no the customer must turn on their heel and walk away. They should not take the money.As Rikki explained you just have to go! Traders want the business so if a customer makes a scene showing they only have Bitcoin the seller will want to accept their sats.If a seller doesnt want to accept Bitcoin its usually not due to infrastructure shortfalls since you can buy a cheap Chinese smartphone on the market with a sim card and a data plan for $20 and the connection here is huge. It is the perfect country to carry out the Bitcoin experiment.This brings us to the interesting part which is getting to the why the reason behind not accepting Bitcoin. Sometimes it is simply because the owner of the restaurant or hotel has confused Chivo with Bitcoin it is more common than you think. Other times a quick chat and a few taps on Chivo are enough for them to see how it works.Rikki and Laura had a blast discussing and educating the locals about Bitcoin making great memories along the way.**Prepare and re-prepare**Although the adventure was a lot of fun Rikki said Its not easy and it takes a bit of preparation. You have to plan your routes in advance. Especially when you get away from the main tourist areas where bitcoin is less accepted. In some cases the couple called 20 or 30 hotels before finding a bitcoiner.Undeterred by the challenge these fights were in his opinion the cream in the pot of his traveling adventure. Sometimes we ended up in the craziest places just because we were looking for places that accept Bitcoin. They joke that Satoshi Nakamoto was the driving force behind his daily decision making.Traveling solo with Bitcoin also meant that the pair were forced to engage with the locals on a more intimate level making human connections along the way.**Sorry Satoshi but museums dont accept Bitcoin**Rikki really wanted to see the Mayan ruins of Tazumal a historical site and archaeological museum near Santa Ana. However the heritage sites only accept cash. Rikki was crestfallen and given the opportunity would question President Bukele about such a strange omission of Bitcoin. Why are the museums managed by the Salvadoran Ministry of Culture only cash?.The decision may change as the Bitcoin Law slowly rolls out to affect all walks of society but currently cultural experiences museums and some excursions are cash only. The couple couldnt get into those sites due to their strict rules. Bitcoin farmers should carry a few bucks just in case.**Education education education**Few Salvadorans understand what Bitcoin is how it works or the difference between Lightning Network and on-chain transactions. As Laura points out some Salvadorans think that you can only pay in Bitcoin if you use the Chivo app. They are unaware of other Lightning wallets like BlueWallet or Wallet of Satoshi.In the Chivo app itself there are no teaching tools for users who want to learn about Bitcoin. Rikki explained that nobody here knows anything about Bitcoin. They didnt provide a second of education to the people of El Salvador. Laura added If people had learned about Bitcoin they wouldnt be using the app.Given the lack of information and education of Salvadorans it is therefore the responsibility of Bitcoiner tourists to take their time with the locals. They must share their knowledge about Bitcoin and be patient while Salvadorans begin to understand the monetary network.As Michael Saylor often says  it takes thousands of hours to understand Bitcoin. The Bitcoin Law was quickly passed and implemented and many locals have not had the time to understand the technology.**Come to El Salvador and spend your Bitcoin here**This is not so much advice as a plea from Rikki and Laura on behalf of the Bitcoin community in El Salvador.Come to El Salvador and spend your Bitcoin. This increases awareness broadens education levels through network effects and word of mouth and ultimately encourages more and more people to use the Bitcoin network they said.For Rikki the more you trade the more you learn. The more you learn the more you study and use it for good.For cryptocurrency development contact us[https//www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development](https//www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development),3,1.0,2,2022-01-28 05:34:42
Will you use the NFT Profile option when Reddit launches it?,Twitter launched its NFT profile picture option over a week ago for Twitter blue users on iOS devices. This didnt sit well with some folks. They felt that Twitter shouldnt have launched this feature as there were a lot of features that users wanted but Twitter has ignored for a long time. A Github contributor even released a code that allowed people to automatically block those that use the NFT profile picture. If you dont verify the NFT the background is circular and if you verify yours it becomes hexagonal. It seems like Reddit wants to do the same thing and it may not be welcomed. It will bring dichotomy. Some of us just want to collect affordable NFTs like Anime NFTs from Goku for the fun of it. We dont fancy the dichotomy that will occur once this is done.,3,1.0,3,2022-01-27 14:56:32
While the majority of crypto coins are environmentally unfriendly a few projects are working to improve environmental efficiency.,Cardano and Stellar are the two most popular mainstream coins that are both sustainable and solve some major issues. However I came across another project that is exciting because it involves such a large number of people.We should promote and use more crypto projects that are solving real-world problems. Rather than having a phoney buzz coins having fake hypeWhile some overhyped projects such as doge or shiba appear to have no real-world application and rely solely on the hype. And  a relatively new project named bob coin creating thousands of jobs while having social and cultural impact and its very wfficiwnt in terms of pollution as this firm uses EVs in their system.,3,1.0,14,2022-01-27 05:01:25

Why doesnt everyone store all their assets in one place? seems inconvenient to jump through hoops.,Ive seen people have assets in all kinds of different places. Why is this? I would understand having more than one place in-case you get hacked or breach. If you use a solid secure wallet like CoinOvys and  if you be sensible.

Profiting off Stable coins,A stablecoin is a  crypto coin whose price is designed to be fixed to a cryptocurrency fiatmoney or to exchange traded commodities like gold and silver. A good example is $USDT. Stablecoins are important crypto assets to hold for risk adverse investors because of their of their minimal volatility as well as their independence from the fluctuation of other coins. They only track the value of the asset they are fixed to.Minting is simply the process of creating a new coin. It is considered a process in crypto mining. It involves staking a significant amount of crypto for the chance a high reward in the form of transaction fees paid by the system users in a blockchain. Due to the significant amount of investment required stablecoin minting is usually considered quite a risky venture. Notable platforms like Konstellation.tech help reduce this risk greatly by reducing the required staking fees and making stablecoin minting accessible to everyone. ,3,1.0,0,2022-01-24 14:29:26
Mass adoption is immanent. It takes time as humans naturally hate change. Thats just the way it is.,We as a race must embrace change and progress. yet we resist. Theres also the issue of peoples aversion to uncertainty. People will generally wait for others to do the new thing and then based on the outcome theyll decide to whether do it or not.Its the same with cryptocurrency. Dont expect full adoption to happen overnight. However if we keep up this pace well get there eventually.If anything were already starting to see crypto compatible credit and debit cards from Binance Coinbase and Baanx which technically isnt full crypto payment but is definitely providing more exposure for crypto plus people will get crypto cash backs on these cards. Its slowly but surely happening. So just give it time.,3,1.0,2,2022-01-22 15:13:07

I think that credit and debit cards services are among the top services that banks have. And these are giving them some really strong advantage on crypto.,Im not going to say that cryptocurrencies aim to take over banks or replace them but I mean I mean if crypto want to get recognition it needs to be able to deliver its investors with credit/debit cards which allow them to use their crypto directly.I understand that crypto is a digital asset and that its value is intangible but if people could actually have their hands on crypto cards this would automatically add some kind of safety and security and were already seeing some platforms giving their users this opportunity like Baanx for example.I believe that crypto cards are going to happen no matter how long it might take but crypto is going to be the future of payments.,3,1.0,2,2022-01-21 18:23:44
Is decentralization necessary for blockchain development?,The general idea of economic decentralization is the fundamental pillar of cryptoeconomics. But as of today not everything we see in blockchain is 100% decentralized as it should be. Can this impede the growth of blockchain technology as it should be? Probably yes.Although there are projects like DIG and others which promote the idea of economic decentralization at the root i.e. their economic basis is decentralization to motivate upcoming startups and progamers to bring out more innovations and services for the blockchain.For this kind of protocols show their idea of total decentralization from the very beginning.Do you think 100% decentralization is necessary to continue to break the limits of the blockchain?,3,1.0,3,2022-01-21 12:50:29
I pray you dont fall victim to rug pulls especially when your projects tank ,Lately crypto has experienced a surge in memberships and this is equally a good thing and a bad thing. Most of the people that are new to space always have the sole aim of making ridiculous amounts of money thats unfortunately impractical and almost impossible. The volatile nature of crypto means theres no real perfect trader there only exist traders with good discipline and patience to endure the market. Im not here to kill any dreams from the bottom of my heart I wish all traders success. Unfortunately the truth is it never works that way my friend. Crypto isnt like anything you imagined at all. You spend hours on end studying trends and analyzing different coins before putting your money on shitcoins. After investing you have to endure the pain of watching your projects tank while the coins you ignored all shoot up. This isnt the time to panic and go on a buying rage its the time to relax and let it be. This is the time to stop watching that BS YouTuber who lies about his gains anyway. It is also the perfect time to stop looking at other peoples portfolios and regretting your own choices. Its such moments of desperation that lead some traders into falling victim to rug pulls. Avoid them at all cost unless you are able to invest in liquidity pools especially those with real and juicy APYs like Aggregated Finance (AGFI) LBT LMaaS ORE protocol liquidity pool etc.More people here should keep their eyes on a 5-10 year timeframe for their investments thats a sweet spot when it comes to solid projects like BTC and ETH. Sure a lot of the alts you hold probably wont survive 10 years but those are side-projects you could consider as well. ,3,0.8,5,2022-01-21 10:46:32

The Creator of The Copy Trading Concept Is A Genius,Truth be told those that cant trade or do not want to trade are thankful to whomever birthed the concept of copy trading. Copy trading means copying the trading of professional traders that are doing well. It is available in different markets like the forex market and crypto market. Usually in the crypto market copy trading allows traders to automatically copy the trade of wallets with high returns trading volumes. This is a saving grace for me. To make it easy I use Tycoon.io for copy trading. Why stress myself looking at charts when I can copy?,3,1.0,12,2022-01-18 12:56:09

Bitcoin isnt a reliable payment option I dont know why we even try to use it as such,Even when using the Lightning Network (which I think is centralized since 20 nodes control more than half of the network). Bitcoin I believe will evolve into a form of wealth storage rather than a form of payment. If we want to see cryptocurrency become more mainstream we need faster decentralized payment methods.While were still a long way from widespread adoption wallets like Coinbase Binance and Eidoo are already issuing credit/visa crypto cards and new services like CoinOvy are working on completely replacing Apple Pay and Venmo with crypto payment solutions. So eventually I believe crypto will be adopted by the general public even if Bitcoin is not one of them.,3,1.0,12,2022-01-17 18:57:57
Will football be financed purely out of crypto in the future,I am not the first to ask this [question](https//www.euronews.com/2021/12/02/is-the-future-of-football-financing-in-cryptocurrency) I think its apparent that many people are wondering this as well. With all the hype that was pushed into coins like PSG and F11 its no wonder that people are seriously asking this question and I dont blame them.Sports have always been a profitable investment ever since Roman times people will pay to be entertained and theres no doubt about that.

How do you define mass adoption? This buzzword seems to be thrown around but it could mean a lot of things,Personally I believe that cryptocurrencies are being accepted by a variety of businesses and that Bitcoin has even been approved as a legal money by a government. Is that however the widespread adoption weve been hearing about? I honestly dont know.People are more interested in crypto these days and there are experiments on to use crypto as a payment currency. Platforms like Baanx for example let users to get credit and debit cards in exchange for their cryptocurrency. That I feel is a good strategy to make crypto more mainstream.So as I previously stated Im not sure what the direct definition of mass adoption is or how we can verify that it has already occurred.

People who doubt cryptocurrencys ability to become the next money will change their minds very soon.,Ive been interested in cryptocurrency for the past two and a half years. Until this year I never imagined that cryptocurrency could be used as a regular payment method. To be honest this market is rapidly expanding and people from all over the world are now interested in investing in cryptocurrency. But when you think about it what does cryptocurrency require to be considered the next money?Adoption can occur only when cryptocurrency is used as a legal payment currency. El Salvadors acceptance of cryptocurrency as legal tender is a promising sign. However I believe that making cryptocurrency an international payment currency is necessary. This is what will entice more people to visit the crypt. Im referring to platforms such as CoinOvy.,2,0.67,20,2022-01-14 19:37:17
Coinbase and PayPal Join TaxBit Network to Get Free Tax Forms for Cryptocurrencies,TaxBit wants to prevent cryptocurrency users from spending thousands of dollars a year to generate cryptocurrency tax forms.Cryptocurrency tax compliance company TaxBit is working to bring together leading industry companies such as Coinbase and Binance.US within a network to enable free 2021 tax forms for users.The crypto tax software provider announced on Tuesday the launch of the TaxBit Network a certified network that aims to democratize crypto tax calculations and tax forms by providing the necessary data for tax filing to all users of the network for free. .The TaxBit Network at its launch includes some 20 major cryptocurrency-related companies in the United States  including firms such as PayPal Binance.US Coinbase FTX.US Gemini Celsius Network Blockchain.com Venmo Paxos OkCoin and BlockFi.As part of the initiative all users of a certified company in the TaxBit network will be able to receive free and accurate tax forms for 2021. In addition several participating platforms will incorporate a quick TaxBit registration within their applications to simplify access to tax information tools.If a user has taxable transactions on platforms that are not part of the TaxBit Network there will be a cost to retrieve the tax forms from off-network platforms  TaxBit noted.The new development aims to remove barriers to adoption of [cryptocurrencies development](https//www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development) in general ensuring that cryptocurrency users in the US can comply with taxes without spending tons of money. Historically the process of generating cryptocurrency tax forms cost individuals hundreds to thousands of dollars per year depending on whether they were using DIY software or hiring an accountant TaxBit said.Binance.US CEO Brian Shroder noted that the companys participation in the TaxBit network is a crucial step in its commitment to security and compliance especially after President Joe Biden signed the infrastructure law in November.TaxBit is a leading cryptocurrency-focused tax compliance firm that brings together tax attorneys and software developers to build software that simplifies and automates the cryptocurrency tax filing process.

The rise of NFTs the blockchain gaming platforms. All these happening right now show that the future of gaming is heavily relying on decentralization And not gonna lie this looks kind of promising.Personally I believe that this is going to be taking the worldwide gaming industry into a next level especially that this is giving an actual value to the games themselves and to the in-game assets as well. And with platforms and projects like Citrus for example were seeing that NFTs and gaming are going together very well.

Colombia is 11th in cryptocurrency transactions in the world,The commerce tourism and real estate sectors allow this payment option and seek to work with the financial system with which they already pilot.Last week the proptech La Haus sold an apartment in Santa Marta to a client who lives in Medellin but who was abroad at the time of finalizing the operation and also paid in the bitcoin cryptocurrency.It was the first operation of this type in Colombia and the second that the firm carried out after a similar operation in Mexico.Although this crypto active and others such as ethereum have been booming and gaining value for a decade its use in Colombia despite greater popularity has still been limited to some subsectors of commerce and tourism but it is not yet a means of payment. widespread because at this time neither the Bank of the Republic nor the Government recommend its use because in case of losses there is no one responsible for the resources.In the country there are more than 500 sites such as small businesses technology and video game centers where it is allowed to pay with crypto assets.Just to mention a few where they receive cryptocurrencies are Olfabrand Café de la Luna Lela Taco Time Colombia Wellness Spa Corner Bistro La Tortata Ravala Viator Transfers & tours Parts Pizza Entrevolcanes y Costillitas Kioto Oriental En la embers and Empanadas a 1000 Café Calle 52 TFM Soluciones Drone 4 Us Aeriial Vehement Masters Technologies Maitek SAS Worldtech Aso Dent Clinic M&M Optics Lili Lacta Fit Tech Fitness.That is why the Financial Superintendence is carrying out a pilot in a controlled environment with nine supervised entities which have alliances with crypto-asset exchange platforms to measure how their clients resources could be integrated and converted into crypto-assets.The largest banks in the country together with other supervised entities carry out these exercises that should yield results in the coming months.In addition given the increasing popularity of the [development of cryptocurrencies](https//www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development) the government decided that since April people and companies that make transactions with cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin in excess of US$150 or US$450 if they are multiple must report it to the Information Unit. and Financial Analysis (UIAF).This in order to prevent operations that are used for illicit purposes such as money laundering and financing of terrorism.Jehudi Castro Vice President of Innovation and Future of La Haus says that as a technology company it makes perfect sense that we adopt bitcoin because it is transparent and although he recognized that the cryptoactive has experienced strong volatility at the time of the transaction of a property is calculated on a real-time exchange rate and converted to legal tender. He said that the entire portfolio is intended to be in cryptocurrencies which would facilitate cross-border transactions.For his part Maximiliano Hinz from the Binance Latam exchange platform says that the number of properties that are being marketed in bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is going to be greater and greater since it is already a reality in Mexico in Colombia and in Uruguay and in Argentina is becoming more and more normal due to the benefits that they bring since the funds are traceable which is much safer than making a purchase of a property with cash or bank transfer which are the methods that we are most accustomed to.Bitcoin he says would become an annex to a bank transfer since it is digitized money but with the benefit that people do not necessarily have to be in the country.,2,1.0,0,2022-02-08 06:14:27

How the bull run affect NFTs,I wont lie to you the history shows that bullruns in the market of crypto affects NFTs badly mainly because the attention that should be aimed at NFTs is now directed at the overall cryptomarket. So I guess now is the best time as ever to hoard your NFTs rather than sell them like the crazed maniac you were doing before. Its not time to slow down and yes start accumulating your NFTs. I like this strategy and this is what I try to go for. Im currently considering using Yunometa to accumulate NFTs and hold for a while until they start pumping again. Until they I thik its good tio take it easy and slopw down.

Cryptocurrencies are the new frontier according to a financial researcher,Optimism around the long-term adoption of digital assets remains high despite the quantitative volatility of recent weeks.In an exclusive television interview with Fox Business on Wednesday JMP Securities director of fintech research Devin Ryan spoke candidly about a number of topics within the[ development of cryptocurrency](https//www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development) industry.

He also stated that [development of cryptocurrencies](https//www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development) are the new frontier and went on to predict that the overall growth of the sector will be preceded by short-term volatility as these technologies compete for mass adoption.In response to a question about efforts by Miami and New York to create a statewide digital asset in addition to Arizona and Wyoming pursuing various methods of adopting Bitcoin Ryan stated that there is tremendous innovation and capital formation.  and that states and countries will be willing to become technology-enhancing venues.,2,1.0,0,2022-02-05 05:50:37
Theres value in struggle ,Theres value in struggling to reach your goal and big goals reached too big often are not savored. This is why lottery winners and people who gain a sudden windfall often blow it away too soon. Nothing is as sweeter as victory at the end of struggle. Remember this when you push through another bear market and watch your portfolio dip. Whether you make it or not you will not be the man you used to be you will have matured by the next trend and you should be grateful for that.

Nintendo studies how to use NFTs in a way that does not diminish the fun,The developer of the Super Mario and Pokémon franchises cares more about offering a good experience to its players than winning the console war.After releasing its latest financial results report Nintendo held a live Q&A session in which it reportedly expressed its interest and potential in the metaverse in bringing Blockchain and the [development of NFT ](https//www.blockchainx.tech/non-fungible-token-development)technology to the market. their video games.According to David Gibsons Twitter senior analyst at MST Financial he asked what the Japanese gaming giant thought about the metaverse and NFTs and was confirmed that they are not currently working on anything but are still defining what they could offer to players. What do you think of the metaverse and NFTs?We have an interest in this area we feel the potential in this area but we wonder what joy we can provide in this area and this is hard to define at the moment (hey Facebook etc take note!)It is notable that Nintendos main concern is the joy we can bring to gamers and fans. It is evident that they are being cautious regarding any possible introduction of [NFT development](https//www.blockchainx.tech/non-fungible-token-development) or integrations within the metaverses. These words from the creators of the Pokémon and Zelda franchises come at a time when other major video game and console companies are experimenting with blockchain-based games.Until now Ubisoft has developed an NFT platform called Ubisoft Quartz and Castlevania creator Konami released its own NFT collection. Meanwhile Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard for $69 billion and confirmed that Xbox will work on developing metaverse platforms.However Ubisofts introduction of Quartz and Digits has been met with considerable backlash from its community and recently Ubisoft executive Nicolas Pouard has suggested that players may not yet fully understand the benefits of Quartz and Digits. the NFTs.During the financial report Nintendo announced a profit loss of 2.5% in the nine months to December as a shortage of computer chips affected its production.,2,1.0,0,2022-02-04 05:48:32

MicroStrategy just bought another $25m Bitcoin,Microstategy just bought another $25 million to add to its portfolio of existing bitcoin. This is quite huge. Some companies especially investment organizations have started adding the forerunner of cryptocurrencies into their portfolio of investments. Gone are those days when Bitcoin and crypto in general was seen as a fad. More Centralized organizations are even adding crypto trading into their features. They are allowing traders to copy trade from Tycoon.io. Some traditional financial institutions have created crypto desks for their users to buy Bitcoin and altcoins. The massive adoption of crypto is awesome.With the ease of usage of Bitcoin it is not surprising that companies that once ignored it are not embracing it.,2,1.0,2,2022-02-02 17:32:04

Digital crypto payment options need more attention,Digital payments at first started with banks and credit cards then it shifted to payment apps like PayPal and Alipay and what most users fail to realize that theyre paying high fees so basically using cash is way cheaper. Even with high fees a lot of individuals and businesses heavily rely on online payments and in my opinion cryptocurrency payments are the key element that will be taking digital payments into the next level.Using crypto for payments will not only minimize your fees but youll also have privacy when conducting any transaction. For example using Bitcoin Latinum will provide near zero fees faster and more secure online transactions making it the perfect crypto payment solution.,2,1.0,4,2022-02-01 15:38:56

Giving some new unique exchanges a shot,Blockchain technology works for a lot of industries. One notable example of the effectiveness of blockchain technology is the cryptocurrency exchange. Many businesses now want to launch their crypto exchange and benefit from the technologys many uses.Coming across so many crypto and traditional exchanges theres a big difference in their quality and what they have to offer. As most people find their save space in one of the top10 Exchanges its often beneficial for the investor to take a look at smaller ones.Fusang as an Exchange I recently came across is a unique blend of the above mentioned. Its a securities exchange where digital security tokens can be listed traded and stored. Its like Amazon but for digital securities. The exchange is the marketplace to list your security token the product and investors can buy and make a settlement in a compliant and safe manner.So to sum it up Do your research and look up some unique Exchanges.

Celebrity spamming us on Twitter,Man anyone else tired of these cringey celebrities trying to sound smart and informed entering the NFT market through the widest door and then expecting themselves to be relevant? Well I am sick of it. Whether it be Mike Tyson (sorry Mike) Serena Williams or Jimmy Fallon all of those guys know nothing about crypto and just want to make quick money easy. And this is unfortunate because this affects both parties badly. They make themselves look bad and they make NFTs look cringey too. Im glad there is work in place to make markets with specific categories for celebrities to sell their NFTs on it without spamming the entirety of the Internet. Im glad there are platforms like Yunometa because it is not only ideal for the celebrity but it also gives them a target audience to adhere to. The actual audience that will buy said NFTs. This should be the norm and this should have  been in place a while back. Because celebrities themselves deserve to enter the market and their target audience who will actually buy it or are even interested. Who knows this could be its own social media platform later on.,2,1.0,2,2022-01-31 10:00:01

Yes it is still early dont worry ,I know many people think that its the peak for crypto and everyone you know owns a little here and there but dont let that confuse you. Thats only the percentage YOU perceive on the day-to-day. In reality [the actual % of the world in cryptocurrency](https//www.investopedia.com/tech/how-much-worlds-money-bitcoin/#~text=Bitcoin%20was%20worth%20only%20about7%25%20of%20the%20worlds%20money) is much less than you would assume.  I know the majority of the those missing from the crypto world are third world citizens who cant afford to take risks like crypto but believe me as a third world citizen Im telling the wave is coming and more and more people are entering this world to escape financial crashes all around.  Covid has not been gentle on the smaller countries more severely than the large ones. If you follow news youll quickly come to find that third world government are quickly shutting down crypto operation whether that may be India Kazakhstan and most recently [Turkey](https//www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/s6meft/crypto_investment_is_alive_and_well_in_turkey/)  So why is that? Why are small countries going all out against the crypto market? Well maybe because in those places the rich own the largest piece of the cheese and are going nuts watching the poor take nibbles off of it in the markets. Theyre sick to their stomach watching us trade NFTs and make it big on Apes and Royal Falcons. And that will NEVER change.  Rich people in small places rely on the poors lack of knowledge and misguided investments if you ever see them raging know that something is going right for the trickle-fed people beneath them.,2,1.0,1,2022-01-30 17:51:02

Belgian MP Says He Will Receive Entire Salary in Bitcoin — ‘We Can No Longer Remain Ignorant of This New World,This is an excerpt from an article published by Bitcoin.comChristophe De Beukelaer a member of the Brussels Parliament said in a blog post on his personal website that he will receive his 2022 salary in bitcoin.The lawmaker explained that with the blockchain we are at the dawn of a revolution of the same order as what we experienced with the internet 30 years ago. He believes that all sectors will be disrupted adding that in other countries large institutions are beginning to invest massively in crypto assets in order not to miss this gigantic opportunity.Noting that it is the role of politicians to make the population aware of these societal changes that are coming he stressedWe can no longer remain ignorant of this new world. Its a bit like clinging to the carriage or the candle as cars and light bulbs appear. Adoption is going to be exponential.To generate interest around bitcoin and the crypto industry the lawmaker has decided to convert his entire salary for the whole of 2022 into bitcoin the post details.This is good news for crypto crypto trading and even copy trading from the likes of Tycoon.io.

It took a long time for companies to admit the power of the blockchain but we have finally gotten there boys,We all know that businesses operate in different ways and that each has its own set of processes and procedures to follow but one issue that all businesses face is the supply chain.Blockchain technology offers a cost-effective and efficient solution to this problem and were not just talking about quick product delivery.In recent days blockchain platforms have done an excellent job particularly in the supply chain with these platforms first enabling faster and less expensive product delivery.Furthermore platforms such as SUKUs Omni aim to increase transparency in business connections by allowing for clear product tracking. Having said that I am convinced that blockchain platforms are receiving far less than they deserve.,2,1.0,6,2022-01-28 14:35:08

A beginners guide to index investing,Index investing is a form of investing that uses a passive approach that attempts to generate returns like a broad market index. The approach is essentially a buy-and-hold strategy to replicate the performance of a specific index—usually an equity or fixed-income index—by purchasing the component securities of the index. This passive approach is advantageous because of the lower management fees and expense ratios (ERs) when compared with actively managed funds. Index funds also tend to be more tax-efficient due to few number of trades usually done. Another appealing quality of index investing is that it is an effective method of diversifying against risks. In recent years digital assets have become a very lucrative portfolio for index investing. TThe meteoric rise of the value of cryptocurrency has been a major driver for this. However there is an issue of inadequate understanding of the crypto space. To solve this problem and make index investing on digital assets a lot easier it is advisable to leverage platforms with the right level of expertise and insight into the world of index investing. Beyond the ease it is also less risky. Several platforms offer good ROI but personally I believe Konstellations VegaX is noteworthy because of its hassle-free user interface and excellent ROI (Over 30%).Whichever path you decide to take on your index investing journey the future looks good!,2,0.53,4,2022-01-28 09:53:47

Where to head when it all crumbles,There comes a time in every journey where everything starts to fail we start to hit plateaus and the end seems near all our efforts seem futile and everything we do seems inevitable to fail. This is the most sensitive time during average journey this is where we have to push the strongest common the furthest and with the most heart will intentions. This is where we should put most of our efforts and what would lead us on is our superior strength.So weve hit a wall with her the wall at last. Now where should we go? There arent many choices left there are a few simple choices and procedures that we could maintain. We could no longer head towards large market gaps but instead we should move toward smaller projects. We should push forwards and a bit of projects like for example the royal falcons club that have a small market cap and launch prospect. Projects that could lead the way into the future. Everything around us is crumbling fast this is like that scene in Inception where everything seems to fall. But need not me worried because we could push through only if we push through together.,2,1.0,1,2022-01-26 12:43:36
Dos and Donts of Launching ICOs,Anybody can launch an ICO. From individuals Celebs are doing it its practically unregulated and so anyone can do it. All you need is good marketing and essentially how to set up a crypto/blockchain infrastructure. The truth is you shouldnt start an ICO just because you can. The chances of your ICO becoming a failed project are quite high. Studies show that 40% of ICOs fail and out of the 60% that succeed a good number of them eventually fail. While most of the failed ICOs are usually scams a good number of them fail because of two major reasons poor planning and unrealistic scoping. A good example of poor planning will be starting an ICO just because you can with no strategy or vision. This is certainly bound to fail and invariably become an investor fund sinkhole. Unrealistic scoping on the other hand entails setting unachievable expectations. A good use case here is the Floyd Mayweather and DJ Khalid debacle.If you must launch an ICO my advice is that you engage a platform like Escrow that would demand accountability from you by only releasing investor funds to you only after certain achievable milestones. This way they will ensure both your interests and that of your investors are protected. Thereby reducing the possibility of failure. Your investors can also benefit from high yield stakings leveraging on the escrow protocol. ,2,1.0,1,2022-01-26 11:15:38

What does Microsofts latest acquisition tell us about Bitcoin and the metaverse?,Microsoft recently announced a big acquisition. Extraordinary treatment reveals extraordinary vision on the part of the company. What are the true plans of the great technology? What does all this mean for Bitcoin and the metaverse?**Big Tech fully understands the importance of content in the next evolution of the Internet.** Having consoles and hardware is of little value without quality content. Microsoft publicly announced its plans to buy video game giant Activision Blizzard in a 100% cash deal worth over US$68 billion. A historic deal that reveals Microsofts priorities right now. We need support for many platforms in the metaverse said Satya Nadella the new CEO of Microsoft. What does this mean? There is no reason to think that the authorities will prevent the transaction. After all Microsoft doesnt have a monopoly on video games. Of course with this acquisition the company is ranked number three in the sector by revenue after Tencent and Sony. The [metaverse](https//www.blockchainx.tech/know-everything-about-blockchain-metaverse) is mentioned. But it is clear that Microsofts intention at first is to feed content from its Game Pass subscription platform. Lets think of a Netflix but for video games. Which means that the user will be able to enjoy video games from the phone and tablet thanks to the cloud. That is we can do without expensive consoles and sophisticated specialized equipment. Obviously Microsoft is looking for a Netflix model. Everything seems to indicate that Satya Nadella is following the example of Disneys Bob Iger with his latest acquisition. Bob Iger brought Disney back to life with big acquisitions that brought a lot of new and highly franchiseable content to the brand. I am referring of course to the acquisitions of Pixar Marvel LucasFilms National Geographic and 21th Century Fox. What does Microsoft gain from this acquisition? Warcraft Diablo Overwatch Call of Duty and Candy Crush among others. These are well-known games with a huge fan base. In other words Microsoft is getting community. Content and subscribers. These names will now add to Microsofts already quite extensive portfolio. The thing is serious. And I wouldnt be at all surprised by reactions from the competition. Now lets talk about the metaverse. The metaverse needs two things Content and community. Then the construction begins. And as the build progresses new content is created and the community expands. Obviously it is a process. And all in due time. Meta ( Facebook ) Roblox and Microsoft are taking a stand. It is very clear that Big Tech will have a very important role in the construction of the [metaverse](https//www.blockchainx.tech/know-everything-about-blockchain-metaverse). The metaverse in all likelihood will be a mixed universe. We will have centralized actors decentralized actors and hybrid actors. On social media we will surely continue to hear advocates of radical decentralization complain about anything that is not 100% decentralized. However users continue to adopt solutions in a mixed way. People in practice tend to be more moderate and pragmatic than advertised. Social networks unleash radicalism. But in many cases it is a rhetorical radicalism. We have to recognize that the Big Tech have a lot of resources to be able to achieve the objectives that are set. The metaverse is coming. And the Big Tech will play a prominent role. We must remember that crypto is also a niche. If we only listen to what is said within the niche with great difficulty we will be able to see the whole picture. If we limit ourselves to reading only Twitter  we could come to think that there is a revolution out there made up of millions of highly committed militants. The enemies are perfectly marked Governments  central banks international banks and multinational corporations. The goal is total decentralization. Which is actually another way of saying by the people and for the people with the help of technology. According to this vision we have a protagonist and his antagonist. In other words there is a conflict. A war of the people against the powerful. Which could mean that the success of one is the defeat of the other. That is what is hinted at in the speech. But Im afraid the reality is very different. Bitcoin and Big Tech do not get along very well at the narrative level. But the market tends to see them as members of the same family. In fact Big Tech goes up. And Bitcoin goes up. Big Tech low. And Bitcoin goes down. The market whether we like it or not puts Bitcoin Ethereum  NFTs and Big Tech in the same bag. Apparently everything belongs to the great family of technological innovation. Governments banks and big capitals have expressed their interest in Bitcoin. The same investor who invests in Tech usually ends up investing in Bitcoin and crypto. The investor who is collecting NFTs also plays video games of all kinds. Most people do not separate the product coming from a decentralized system from another coming from a centralized system. Everything is mixed. Because the user after all uses what he pleases. What is the metaverse? A universe full of opportunities. The metaverse fintech NFTs and Big Tech all correlate positively with Bitcoin. Lets go back to the past and remember for a moment the adoption of Bitcoin by PayPal . How did the Puritans in the country react? Bla bla bla. Private key custody Satoshi and the seven dwarfs. Bla bla bla. How did the market react? How did the price react? With gigantic optimism. In this space there is a very large gap between what is said and what is done. My recommendation is to go to the facts and be very skeptical of the rhetoric. Right now we have a bitcoin dragged down by macroeconomic reality. The market expresses its concern in the face of uncertainty. Ultimately the US Federal Reserve is the biggest player in all of this. They set the tone and investors follow. Heres the problem. We still do not know for sure what is going to happen with monetary policy. We know there will be cuts. But all the details are still unknown. Now sooner or later the market will find the clarity it seeks. The waters will return to their course. And investors will return to invest in innovation. Bitcoin is greatly favored with the digitization process. Words more words less the fate of Bitcoin is closely linked to the evolution of the Internet. Despite the various opinions Big Tech and Bitcoin walk hand in hand in this adventure.,2,1.0,1,2022-01-24 06:37:14

Tokenization and its top players,The process of tokenization provides limitless possibilities to many different industries. All sectors that produce or exchange assets can take advantage of tokenization by creating digital representations of their products or assets on the blockchain. The process of tokenization provides several advantages to asset owners and end consumers. In many cases an advantage enjoyed by an issuer directly translates to a similar benefit for the investor.Fusang is a digital securities exchange that tokenizes real-world assets for availability and usage on a blockchain. The first fully-licensed digital securities exchange in Asia Fusang is currently at the forefront of the push towards tokenization as it offers issuers the opportunity to expand their horizons through blockchain technology.Fusang provides clients with an end-to-end platform that guides the tokenization process from start to finish.

I dont see the adoption of dApps too far away.,Right now the market is down and many businesses dont want anything to do with crypto.

ETH Value Is On A Decline What Does It Mean For Traders?,The way the value of ETH is dropping hastily I wont be surprised if the color red had a meeting with it. It seems to be dropping quickly and has gone below $2500 at the time of writing this. I feel that Ethereum and other alt coins have a pact with BTC to reduce in value once the BTC falls in value. They do not have a mind of their own and it is annoying. For crypto traders especially new ones I wonder how they are coping in this market. It can be discouraging. For lazy traders like me I merely copy the trades of highly performing traders from Tycoon.io and other crypto social trading platforms then fold my legs.,2,0.75,3,2022-01-22 14:44:00

It seems the market has dipped yet again meaning we get to pick up bags at a discount. What are you buying?,This is where the FUD starts but if youre anything like me and youve been around for a while. You know that now is prime time purchasing. Now is the best time to buy your crypto of choice at a discount. Im curious to hear what everyone is trying to pick up a bag of this dip. Im personally going to be picking up $MATIC and $SUKU as I think SUKUs ecosystem is absolutely incredible and could very well lead the charge towards mass adoption as far as the metaverse is involved.,2,1.0,1,2022-01-21 17:20:57
The Crypto.com hack is creating more FUD in the market,Lets face it the market cannot handle any more FUD. Its doing bad enough on its own. The market needs positive reassurance and I mean REALISTIC positive reassurance. Like that kid who accidentally became a millionaire after releasing his NFT selfie set. Like the positive uptrend in floor value of the Royal Falcons Club. These projects rely on engagement and market success. At these tough times people should look at the success of these small underdogs for hope. Because hope really still does exist. It exists for me and it exists for you. Let the largest assets crash and fall. Let the largest crypto exchange get hacked and fall into rubble it was a farce anyway. Focus on your own successes assure yourself multiple inputs of income and invest in the future. In projects that will change the future. ,2,1.0,4,2022-01-21 16:34:28
Stablecoin Minting!,A stablecoin is a  crypto coin whose price is designed to be fixed to a cryptocurrency fiatmoney or to exchange traded commodities like gold and silver. A good example is $USDT. Stablecoins are advantageous because of their minimal volatility and this is influenced by assets which can be outside the crypto ecosystem. The are also independent of correlation hence they are not affected by the fluctuation of other coins.Minting on the other hand is part of the crypto mining process to create a new coin. Consider the analogy you mine gold and then mint gold coins for circulation. This is basically the same thing as crypto coin minting. While crypto mining uses a Proof of Work (PoW) protocol crypto minting uses a Proof of Stake (PoS) protocol. The POS involves staking which is simply creating new on the blockchain. Staking usually requires depositing a significant sum to participate. This can expose the investor to an equally significant risk. However there is also the possibility of high reward in the form of transaction fees paid by the system users.Combing the stability of stablecoins and the profitability of minting can be very beneficial . A few platforms like Konstellation.tech offer this service. They simply the process of minting by significantly reducing the staking fees thereby making stablecoin accessible to everyone. ,2,0.75,2,2022-01-21 10:59:17
Football (soccer) in crypto isnt receiving much attention because it isnt American,  There is no underestimated the power fan tokens have reached. Take PSG for example they have made upticks like no other. It is being overshadowed because most of the cryptomarket is essentially American. And Americans dont like talking about Football (soccer) but it is definitely growing and growing fast. Just now new tokens are being minted and created such as First Eleven who will elevate the entirety of football watching experience. NFL has a token in study and the UFC is promising fighters 50% returns from their NFT sales.,2,0.75,2,2022-01-21 06:27:55

Are we really close to mass adoption? I mean yeah but we dont even have a clear definition of mass adoption.,I mean everyone around here talks about mass adoption and how crypto is going to be adopted by everyone. I like that but do we have a clear definition for this mass cryptocurrency adoption? I dont think so and this is whats exciting about it everyone can imagine how the future of crypto is going to be. For me the most important thing is that crypto is getting recognition as a payment method. I mean once Im capable of using my crypto to buy my daily needs I would say crypto has reached the ‘mass adoption level. And actually weve hints of that I mean platforms like Binance and Coinbase or CoinOvy are actually letting their users pay their subscriptions and buy their things with their tokens. Thats how I see the mass adoption to be honest. I dont know about you but I believe that crypto payments are going to be more common in the next few years.,2,1.0,1,2022-01-20 16:07:24

Different Crypto Trading Strategies,Regularly we see people stating that they want to give crypto trading a trial especially in the bull market. People tend to forget that even in the bear market there are some crypto traders that make a killing. Some buy newly listed coins and sell them less than a week after for more than what they bought it. Some traders are a fan of futures trading or margin trading. Other traders will not be caught dead doing futures or margin trading because of potential liquidation scenarios. Well different crypto traders have different strategies they use. I have seen some that automatically copy trades of professional traders automatically. They choose the traders that they want to copy. To do these they use copy trading tools like the ones found on Tycoon.io and other places. Decide on what strategy you want and stick to it,2,1.0,2,2022-01-20 11:18:23
If anyone is still thinking about hopping into the blockchain space its still not late at all.,I mean why is it even a question? Blockchain technology is literally shaping the future now. I think that everyone will be finding ways to benefit from this technology and now is the right time especially that this space is still growing and were still going to see huge improvements happening in it.I mean right now blockchain is targeting all the industries in order to get mass adoption. Even brands and brand owners can benefit from this space with platforms like Suku. I think that itll be a big mistake if anyone is willingly ignoring the impact blockchain is having. This is literally a new world and this technology is going to be changing a lot of concepts.,2,1.0,6,2022-01-19 17:24:52
Spain bitcoin is more profitable than buying a flat to rent,A few hours ago Business Insider published a report from which it can be deduced that in Spain buying bitcoin (BTC) would be more profitable than buying a home as an investment to put it up for rent. This is because the chances of [cryptocurrency development](https//www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development) revaluing are much higher in less time.The report points out that **bitcoin is the most profitable financial asset of the last decade**  considering the price increase it has had since then. With a $100 investment in 2010 you would now have $9 million he says. On the other hand this time frame may not even have been enough to recover the investment of the purchase of a home.For example in the center of Madrid the average price of a 40 square meter apartment is almost 200000 euros according to data from Idealista . Recovering this investment would entail a term of 23 years if it is rented at the average rental price in the area for that size which is 700 euros per month according to the platform.In contrast to this as CriptoNoticias reported **buying bitcoin allows you to generate profits in a short time if its price rises**  perhaps even in just minutes or days of trading.In addition it does not require an initial investment as large as a home. You can invest as much money as you want in bitcoin making it accessible to anyone. Above all in the current context of inflation where saving is more difficult. The study noted that according to IE University **15% of Spaniards already have cryptocurrencies**.## Bitcoin looks better as an investment than a home but its high riskThe waiting period to recover the investment in a home is long. However the advantage of this type of investment is that once that time frame has passed the profits can be relatively stable. In contrast to this **buying bitcoin carries a high risk as it can devalue against the euro due to its price volatility** .An example of this is the recent price low that hit $40000 in January from its all-time high of $67800 last November. Although the upward trend that it has had since its inception 13 years ago suggests that it will continue like this beyond the fact that past returns are no guarantee of future returns.An investigation by Visa  among others reveals that **the growth of bitcoin adoption in the last year not only at the individual level but also in companies  will continue to rise** . This promotes the rise in its value considering that the higher the demand the higher its price as analyst Willy Woo pointed out in his predictions about bitcoin for 2022 .Likewise Business Insider maintains that this year is also seen as a good time to buy a home. This is due to the current mortgage interest rate which is negative at -0.5% according to the policy of the Central Bank of Spain for the economy to recover.,2,1.0,11,2022-01-18 09:32:46
Security token boom in Asia,The security token industry is booming in Asia. News out of Singapore recently said that CapBridge Pte LTD. would be starting their own security token exchange. Then we also had the news of CEZEX opening its doors in the Philippines considered to be the first security token trading platform in Asia.However now Fusang Exchange is joining CEZEX in opening up yet another licensed STO venue in Asia. This is only the second one formally approved for trading on the entire continent.Whats interesting about Fusang Exchange is that it will operate as a traditional securities exchange but will also offer security token markets. Whereas CEZEX is a more traditional cryptocurrency exchange Fusang began as a venue for securities.,2,1.0,11,2022-01-17 14:12:12

The Concept of Gifting Your Friends NFTs,When people think of gifts their minds go to tangible things. It could be that car that your wife or husband has craved for a long time. It may be an expensive perfume jewelry wristwatch sneakers PS5 and similar items. Gifts are important to showing people that you love and cherish them. Sometimes we splurge on an expensive gift for them like a trip to their favorite country. What if we gave our loved ones something that they will value as well as appreciate in value. I have been thinking of gifting my friends and family NFTs that are attached to what they love. I could get them an NFT album of their favorite musician. There is a great chance that the NFT album may increase in value in the future  especially if it is from a popular artist. I could gift an Anime NFT to a family member that loves Animes from Goku. By getting them an Anime NFT they could enjoy potential increase in value and even incredible use cases. What do you guys think?,2,1.0,16,2022-01-14 14:14:08

Change is hard and we all agree to that. But once we get to reach the lifestyle that blockchain technology is going to bring we wont be setting to anything less.,I mean ten years ago we wouldve dreamed of living with the technology we have to day even though we were satisfied with what we had right? And today its the same case. Were all happily using the technology we have but once we get to use the blockchain platforms and get to adapt to the lifestyle this tech is bringing we wont be able to live in the same circumstances we used to have.And the fact that this technology and its platforms are tackling all the areas of our lives is a sign that its a matter of time before we all get used to use these platforms which means that all our lifestyles are going to change. For example Suku is a blockchain platform thats allows brands and clients to communicate and to verify the quality and authenticity of the products. When people get used to such platforms the entire online shopping experience will be changing and nobody will be accepting to continue using the old methods we had. This is why the future is so exciting about this technology.,2,1.0,18,2022-01-13 13:57:23
Any aggregated football tokens in the market?,  I know Football teams started their own fan tokens like PSG and others but is it only an individual effort? Or is there a project to aggregate it all into one coherent token?I asked this question a while ago and someone mentioned First Eleven a first of its kind token for football fans a token for all teams (basically the football sport itself lol) that elevates the football watching experience. Gotta say that seems pretty interesting. So are there any other efforts to create one sports token for other sports? I heard the NFL was planning on releasing their own token (albeit just rumours on Twitter for now),2,1.0,14,2022-01-13 11:23:39

How is Vigorish legal?,To those who are unfamiliar with this term in sport betting Vigorish is a 10% commission that bookies  charge on your losses. This means if you place $100 on a bet and end up losing youll pay $110 to the bookies. If this sounds a bit unfair to you then youre not alone. In my opinion this is probably one of the most unfair things ever to happen in the world of sports betting and I thought to discover a way of circumventing it. Thats when I stumbled on [Betswap](https//Betswap.gg). Rather than charge a 10% percent commission on losses they charge 1.5% on winnings instead. I gather that this fee is actually used to cover the operational cost of the platform as well pay the Betswap team. This is quite fair. I would say quickly head over to their website and start betting but for now theyre only in beta testing and would roll full features within the year so we wait. I believe this could be huge for sport bettors and yes Ive got you so Ill be watching this space for you. #powertothebettors💪🏾,2,1.0,8,2022-01-12 09:59:21
Are NFTs Really Worth It?,When you try to discuss the concept of an NFT with an outsider (by outsider I mean someone that is not in the crypto space) they call it an expensive JPEG. Truth be told are they even lying?You know how the traditional art realm has collectors that spend millions of dollars on an abstract piece of art. Sometimes I watch art shows trying to understand why a snobby art collector would pay ten million dollars for a piece of art that was painted by a drunk toddler. You would see a piece of art with paints of different colors splashed on the canvas and it will sell for a shitload of dollars. I have never understood this. When I stumbled into NFTs and appreciated them I started to realize that we are no different from traditional art lovers truth be told. We are alike. We want to appreciate our NFT just like a traditional art collector wants to appreciate their painting on a canvas. Some of us buy NFTs for speculative purpose just like the traditional art lovers. Maybe I would have fallen in love with traditional art if it allowed Anime lovers like me stare at Anime Art and probably buy them. At least for now my type of art is being taken care of by Anime NFT Art marketplace Goku. I can mint Anime NFT art and even trade them.,2,0.75,7,2022-01-12 09:11:57

I played the game a couple of times with my friends but havent mentally invested since. Im outside the scene so Im currently admittedly holding an outsiders perspective on the matter though I feel gaming NFTs are a proper field that will boom soon. Thats why Im trying to get into it before the tidal waves of the mainstream arrives.Someone here pointed out games like Kitty Kart on Kitty Inu P2E games you know? That seems cool and interesting Id like to delve into that though requires more research. How does this sub feel about gaming NFTs?

Whats the deal with CHZ?,I remember it making top news about being a sports fan collectors item and will let you get more fan access into your famous teams as well as the fact that the UFC was basically trying to build their own version on it or something(?) Havent heard of any top news since for some reason.Anyway I came across this coin F11. Apparently First Eleven is mainly targeted at soccer fans generally as it will allow you to get more on your favourite teams as well as contains NFTs and collectibles. So my point is will individual sports coins replace the CHZ market for fan access and such? It seems this is the trend the market is going to.

How JP Morgan manipulate media about Bitcoin,Here is simple example how people forget all news and believe in everything what they read =) JP Morgan USs biggest bank. Its a huge bank with serious reputation in a world. Imagine what analytics work in this bank! Look what they do. 📅**10 november** market start bear trend📅**3 November** 2021 they made a post on Yahoo Finance **JPMorgan renews prediction that bitcoin could hit $146000 - and says its acting more like digital gold than ever**[https//finance.yahoo.com/news/jpmorgan-renews-prediction-bitcoin-could-130511372.html](https//finance.yahoo.com/news/jpmorgan-renews-prediction-bitcoin-could-130511372.html)After 3 month **9 February 2022****JPMorgan says bitcoin fairly priced at $38K — 14 percent below current level**[https//nypost.com/2022/02/09/jpmorgan-says-bitcoin-fairly-priced-at-38k/](https//nypost.com/2022/02/09/jpmorgan-says-bitcoin-fairly-priced-at-38k/)Thats what most analytics and people dont pay attention. They have a lot of money a lot of power in media.

Keeping Crypto updated thanks to forks,Bitcoins ecosystem is the most important one for cryptocurrency mass adoption. As soon as the broad mass enters the crypto-space Bitcoin will be the most important currency in the world and Bitcoins ecosystem will be relevant all around the world.Its one of the biggest ecosystems and it needs to be kept up-to-date. Thats actually what forks are trying to do. Platforms like Bitcoin Latinum for example try to lower the transaction fees and strive to make them safer as well as following a much greener approach.These initiatives will be necessary before the entire world starts accepting cryptocurrency.,1,1.0,0,2022-02-09 19:19:50
Why arent people using crypto credit cards?,Its literally so easy to make one. So many platforms like Binance Coinbase and many others are offering them. I got mine from Baanx and theyre so damn convenient.Most of these cards offer crypto cash back as well which is much valuable than the fiat cash back that conventional cards use.Also these crypto compatible credit cards offer a lot of exposure for crypto as a whole.I dont see why anyone whos in crypto wouldnt invest in a crypto credit card at this point.,1,1.0,1,2022-02-09 19:13:49
Russian crypto regulation,Just like weve been watching after China and India now we are following Russian legislators.

However since then the situation has changed dramatically. The Russian government and the Bank of Russia came to an agreement to recognize crypto as a type of currency. The draft of the law should be introduced on February 18.,1,1.0,0,2022-02-09 19:05:37

Are avatars for social media profiles a big deal?,Sure if youre looking at it from the perspective of adoption. As more people become aware of this the blockchain world will become more popular and in 2-3 years NFt avatars will be commonplace and used in our daily lives without us even realising it.Avatars when combined with the metaverse have the potential to be enormous. Although its still in development Metaverse Avater Nft is a very unique type of Nft. Because its a very unique type it needs to be well developed especially because of its customizable features and the fact that its metaverse based. I tell you the possibilities are endless.These are a few of the most common uses for NFTs. In our daily lives we may use NFTs without even realising it. For example well use tools like NFT avatar maker to customise our NFt avatar for social media handles. Also if you want to customise your avatar I believe the NFT avatar maker tool is a project worth looking into.,1,1.0,0,2022-02-09 15:51:22
An investors insight into Crypto Scams ,Investors have to always analyze the risk associated with any investment they plan to engage in. For crypto investments crypto scams are arguably the biggest risk associated. These scams have over the years instilled fear into investors while also raising the level of skepticism associated with crypto projects.Every crypto investor would like to reduce the risk associated with crypto investments to zero if possible and luckily there appears to be to just that. Some crypto platforms have come up with algorithms and applications that make vetting crypto projects for legitimacy and viability not only possible but simple and straightforward. This means that investors have been given the ability to able to ascertain their true nature before investing. A good mention here is the RiseUp platform.,1,1.0,0,2022-02-09 14:25:49

Winning in a game includes more than just bragging rights,There is nothing better than winning a game. Ill tell you this right here right now. The pride and ego boost involved is like no other and the bragging rights included are not to be overshadowed but some games still offer more... Some games will literally give direct reward and profit just for playing. Just for winning and just for you consistency and this a serious plus that I think should be well considered. NFT games like Kitty Kart Axie and its likes are making such big hype and gaining so many dedicated players and this is directly related to the rewards involved in it.

Bitcoin and Ethereum Rise Double Digits After Increased Institutional Interest in Cryptocurrencies,Major cryptocurrencies are enjoying a bullish rally since the start of 2022 with both Bitcoin and Ethereum posting double-digit gains over the past week.Despite falling as low as $33000 in mid-January Bitcoin has seen an impressive rally during the first week of February.The top cryptocurrency is currently trading above $43000 and has seen a 12% rise in the last seven days according to data provided by CoinMarketCap .As the appetite for Bitcoin has renewed so has investor interest in the second largest cryptocurrency Ethereum .The[ development of Ethereum](https//www.blockchainx.tech/erc20-token-development) is also enjoying a healthy rally posting a 10.3% gain on the week. It is currently trading at just over $3060 after falling as low as $2211 on January 24.Cryptocurrencies in general fell sharply in January alongside traditional markets. Amid news that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates to fight inflation equity markets such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq also fell by about 1% and 3.3% respectively.These figures may seem minor in cryptocurrency terms but integer percentage losses are nothing to write home about for markets as large as these two.## Institutions turn to Bitcoin and EthereumThe latest cryptocurrency crash also seems to have been a buying event for various institutions.MicroStrategy which has become a proxy investment for Bitcoin snapped up another 660 Bitcoin for $25 million on February 1. The companys CEO Michael Saylor reported that the company now owns a total of 125051 Bitcoin which were purchased at an average price of approximately $30000 each.Electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla also reported that its Bitcoin holdings reached nearly $2 billion by the end of 2021. Tesla first bought $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin in February 2021 which now appears to have been a good bet. .The latest marker of recent institutional interest in cryptocurrencies comes from accounting firm KPMG.The Canadian branch of the firm announced yesterday that it had added both Bitcoin and Ethereum to its treasury through Gemini Crypto custody services.A KPMG spokesperson told Bloomberg that Our investment allows us to share our journey our experiences our challenges with [clients and prospects] so that we can help them navigate the world of cryptocurrency.,1,1.0,0,2022-02-09 05:56:58
My house for a bitcoin cryptocurrencies make their way into Spanish real estate,The Tiko *marketplace* already accepts digital currencies in its transactions while experts point out that the incorporation into the demand of the younger generations will boost the [development of cryptocurrencies](https//www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development) and the tokenization of real estate in the countrys real estate sector.  Cryptocurrencies are gaining ground as currency in the Spanish real estate sector. In fact in the face of repeated accusations of a bubble pronounced fluctuations in value and warnings from regulatory bodies about their advertising strategy in the media companies that are betting on cryptocurrencies as the current currency in Spanish *real estate* are making their way with the aim of **promote the use of digital currencies in operations of sale rental or investment in real estate assets** .The home buying and selling *marketplace* Tiko recently announced that it **was accepting cryptocurrencies as a valid form of payment** in its operations. The platform thus became the first Spanish iBuyer to accept digital currencies as a form of payment in its transactions.The decision of the company which **accepts all kinds of cryptocurrencies**  from bitcoins or ethereums to neos or iotas responds to a philosophy of greater flexibility and comfort for buyers according to Ana Villanueva CEO of Tiko for Spain and Portugal  to AxisPrime.Regarding the daily fluctuations in value that [development of cryptocurrencies](https//www.blockchainx.tech/crypto-currency-development) usually experience the company explains that **the value of the property is always expressed in euros** on its platform and acknowledges that it is very likely that at the time of the down payment and at the time of the purchase and sale the exchange rate is different.To prevent fluctuations from affecting any of the parties **Tiko makes two conversions**  one at the time of the deposit and the other at the time of the transaction so that the price of the purchase is never affected by its volatility  underlines Villanueva.Tiko performs two conversions one at the time of deposit and one at sale to avoid the impact of fluctuations The example of Tiko illustrates a change in the conception of the use of cryptocurrencies which can begin to get rid of the label of an essentially speculative product to gradually gain **more weight as a currency in the market for real estate transactions** . This paradigm shift can only go further as Gustavo Adolfo López director of operations of the API Catalonia group and co-author of the book *Proptech Revolution*  points out to Eje Prime. López **focuses on generational change and the green light from regulatory entities**  such as the European Central Bank (ECB) so that the use of digital currencies is consolidated in the Spanish real estate market.The younger generations are used to the use of cryptocurrencies therefore it is they and the administrations when they promote their digital currencies for example the digital euro who will convert cryptocurrencies into currencies of current use indicates López who underlines that the use of cryptocurrencies to pay the amount of a real estate sale in Spain is absolutely legal.In addition López points to **other opportunities generated by the use of cryptocurrencies such as the** ***tokenization*** **of assets**  a practice that pursues the division through shares in the transaction of a property in the digital sphere. We could convert a real estate asset into a financial asset with a return and being able to sell the participation (token) at any time concludes the expert.The tokenization of assets consists of the division of investment in shares of a property in the digital fieldPrecisely this type of operation is what the Spanish proptech Reental is developing ** which **bases its business on the acquisition of real estate and then divides the investment through tokens**  which it markets at a minimum price of one hundred euros offering a return higher than eleven%.The investor only has to register in the *start up* and have a *wallet*  a cryptocurrency bank account in which they will **store the investments in tokens that they want to undertake within the platform** .We are the leading company in Europe in real estate *tokenization*  our platform already has more than 5000 registered users and we have more than 500 investors from fifty countries Eric Sánchez co-founder and CEO of Reental told Eje Prime. It is a very liquid investment and we distribute monthly dividends; the demand is spectacular the tokens last a few hours before the investors get the total number of shares highlights the manager.,1,1.0,0,2022-02-09 05:45:08

Are DAOs really the future of work? Pros and cons of joining a DAO, Lets just clarify what a DAO is DAOs are Decentralized Autonomous Organizations already thats a mouth full but give me a minute DAOs happen when a group of people with a common goal Mission and Vision come together to achieve it in a decentralized way. We removed as many buzzwords as possible. A common meme definition is a group chat with a shared Crypto wallet. DAOs will change how we work and earn forever and we can see it happening already with multiple DAOs raising funding to build the future of work.Pros of Joining a DAOWork with communities you loveIn the traditional organizations you work FOR communities you most times dont care about but with DAOs well the options are endless whatever your interests are its almost certain theres a DAO for it (Find the perfect DAO for you on [Voice)](https//voice.softr.app/) and you can easily join and [start contributing to the DAO ](https//voice.softr.app/)immediately. When you choose to work with a DAO youre choosing to work on something you genuinely love working on.Time flexibilityDAOs are no 9 to 5 you dont have to get up early in the morning miss family time get stuck in traffic on your way back and everything in between. Working with a DAO gives you that time flexibility you need you are home on your PC working on projects you want to work on sounds like the dream the guru sold to you to buy his course doesnt it well no need to pay to get paid instead provide value and get Paid. Network and LearnThe diversity that a DAO brings in the sense that anyone from anywhere can join make it the perfect breeding ground to work Network and learn from absolute geniuses who otherwise you might have never met.You can work with multiple DAOs at the same timeImagine being a Dev at google and being able to contribute to Discord? That should be allowed they arent competitors but in the traditional organization youll probably get fired. Well youre free to work with BanklessDAO while working with FWB DAO.DAOs work on value providedLets face it in most of the traditional workplaces you only get promoted based on the number of hours you put in. The janitor doesnt paid by how neat the floor is but gets fired by how neat the floor is. When working with a DAO if you say you spent 2 hours creating a new design for the site but another contributor makes a better design in 30 minutes The quality of the work and value provided wins. In most DAOs contributing 2 hours and showing up will be rewarded. As thats what DAOs are all about.Now yeah if you are community manager maybe the number of hours youre in the discord matters but if you still need to provide the value of actually managing the community.Con of working with DAOs*obviously DAOs are not perfect they have their flaws also we are not saying the traditional organizations are bad*Slowif you want to go fast go alone if you want to go far go together well DAOs are not the most optimized to go fast yes weve seen instances where DAOs have gone hyper speed and built fast but majority isnt the case most DAOs suffer from decision paralysis and too many ideas. Where tons of people from different backgrounds are trying to collaborate it could take time as everyone wants to contribute. Long terms DAOs will need to solve thisSalary and rewarding ContributorsOne of the biggest flaws with DAOs is figuring out to keep contributors invested through ownership and also making it easy for them to pay their bills without selling their governance tokens. For example james has been contributing effectively for a month and has been recognized by the DAO so they decide to pay him with some governance token worth $4k. Now the issue here is as much as james might want to have a say in decisions he also has to pay the bills so he sells the tokens and this leads to an endless cycle where james has to sell to live. DAOs need to find the perfect balance between rewarding in ownership and proper salary.Are they even Legal?DAOs are dancing on the line of selling securities and not. Wyoming might have legalized them but most other states and countries havent. So DAOs might be putting their members at legal risks? well no one truly knows but this is a huge problem with DAOs as some people will rather not join than take the risk of being on the bad side of the Law. Here is a 2017 [SEC](https//www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2017-131) report stating DAO tokens are securities so are DAO members buying worthless securities?After reading this you might want to join a DAO yourself and just test the waters right? Jump into voice and discover DAOs How to contribute to them and Go full-time on DAOs [https//voice.softr.app/](https//voice.softr.app/)We are on a mission to onboard a million talents into the DAO ecosystem if you want to be part hop into the discord we are currently working on how to let anyone contribute [https//discord.gg/P24Drm3EXa](https//discord.gg/P24Drm3EXa),1,1.0,0,2022-02-08 20:28:19
There are a few energy-efficient crypto currencies to keep an eye on.,Crypto enthusiasts are quick to point out that the traditional financial system is anything but environmentally friendly. According to reports 60 of the worlds largest banks have given $3.8 trillion to fossil fuel companies and 49% of financial institutions do not conduct any climate impact analysis on their portfolio. To power their infrastructure big banks consume a staggering amount of fossil fuels. Does that sound like deflection to you? Consider this according to a recent study 76 percent of crypto miners use renewables as part of their energy mix.Regardless of which side of the coin you are on cryptocurrencies and the technology that underpins them can be both environmentally friendly and profitable. Lets take a look at some of the most fascinating examples.Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR)Its proof-of-stake public network is powered by hashgraph consensus and features incredibly low bandwidth consumption among other things with HBAR as its native energy-efficient cryptocurrency.Bob eco coinThis is a relatively new project on the block but it is creating thousands of jobs and declaring war on pollution through the world of Security Tokens despite having very different functions. Its also the worlds first tokenization of a for-profit social enterprise. Bobcoin is a type of security token that is backed by both equity and assets.SolarCoin (SLR)SolarCoin was launched in 2014 with the goal of being 50 times more carbon efficient than bitcoin. Solarity refers to the point at which the price of 1 SolarCoin (SLR) equals the bid price for 1MWh of solar PV (photovoltaic) generation. ,1,1.0,0,2022-02-08 20:16:12
A possible future of NFTs ,Artists now have a wide range of options for selling their work. They can either sell their original work or make prints of it. This is fantastic for monetizing their artwork but there is a catch you cant sell your art in the digital world. Yes there are many ways to support an artist but NFTs are the way of the future when it comes to owning an artists original hardcopy work.With that considered most of the projects Ive come across seem to be focusing on short game NFTs rather than trying to look into much larger opportunities NFTs can offer.With that in mind the majority of the projects Ive come across appear to be focusing on short game NFTs rather than attempting to investigate the much larger opportunities that NFTs can provide.These are some of the most common applications of NFTs. We may use NFTs without even realising it in our daily lives. For example we will customise our NFt avatar for social media handles using tools like NFT avatar maker. Also I believe the NFT avatar maker tool is a project worth looking into if you want to personalize your avatar.,1,1.0,0,2022-02-08 20:12:44

What it means to make a profit,In the subjective crypto market that it is we often forget what it really means to make a profit. Whenever you ‘buy into a project I know you may believe that for you its just an asset youre collecting but actually youre giving money to an ambitious team to help them drive forwards in their project. I think many people forget or disregard this but when you invest its not just happening for you its happening for the project as well. Whenever you ‘go short youre actually betting against the team and harming them this too you need to take into consideration.This is actually pretty specific for small teams and small projects as those value incoming money the most. This is why its so important that you hold on to small project assets when you invest for a long time not just for your sake but for the sake of the members and the project itself. I invest heavily into small cap projects because I want teams to benefit from it which I know they will but Im not benefactor and I know that I got immense profits whenever they hit an uptrend. It gets back to me tenfold and Im thankful for that. I got my bad in the Royal Falcons Club because I believe in their vision and I know one day they will take off well and Im not letting go. Profits are not subjective despite what you believe when you go long and short youre affecting another group of people and an entire project in the process. ,1,1.0,0,2022-02-08 16:00:11
So youve had your first bad trade…,If you are reading this then you have found this relevant and that can be on any level. Regardless you have found this relevant it means you have incurred a loss on your portfolio. So youve had your first loss. I remember my first loss it was terrible and I felt absolutely horrible. This was back in doge days (pun intended) and I felt like such a loser for getting ripped in a doge trade. It took a while to accept it but losses are part of the game. Losses are a learning experience. I for one learned from that experience not to overleverage and to take it easy and slow when Im trading hard and fast. Losses and wins are literally the name of the game. The most important thing to keep in mind is your daily average. Your daily average (or weekly average depends on how active you are on a trading platform) should always be in the green. By no means take this as advice to go for revenge trading. Do not under no circumstance take a loss then go trade hoping on a compromising gain. If you do that its very unlikely that you actually make any profit. What you can do however is take the same amount of money you lost from that trade and put it in something completely different and new. That way itll be a load of your mind and literally a completely new chance at something else. Nowadays I follow that strategy often I find it works well for me. I took a blow trying to short XRP so now I am gathering the same amount I lost and considering putting it in the Royal Falcons Club NFT collection. This strategy works well for ME so dont take my word for it however take it into consideration. ,1,1.0,0,2022-02-08 15:59:25
NFT or Blockchain Development? ,NFTs have been booming in the last few months however NFTs leave a lot of losses to most of their investors while true blockchain development projects usually obtain a large capitalization in a short period of time.No need to name projects that at the time offered new things for the blockchain and were a total success I think most of us know these projects.I think if we all had the necessary blockchain knowledge and would have known these projects in startup or alpha phase.Decentralized development protocols like DIG have tools and knowledge that they use to fund potential startups and for us mortals to take advantage of these potential successful alpha stage projects as well.,1,1.0,0,2022-02-08 15:57:19

Another day in the crypto market another day towards mass adoption being side-by-side with fiat.,That is something I keep repeating. Stablecoins are the actual money in the cryptocurrency industry so dont dismiss them. Personally I keep roughly 30% of my portfolio in stablecoins like USDT BUSD EURST etc. just to be ready to acquire any asset whenever the opportunity arises. And this weeks drop is again another reminder that we should always be prepared to buy when prices fall.Stablecoins I believe will operate like real money once we reach the long-awaited cryptocurrency general adoption. And it is there that the entire worlds economy will be revolutionized. Stablecoins are already serving as ideal international payment methods; theyre lot faster in terms of transactions much more secure and even less expensive.,1,1.0,0,2022-02-08 14:36:38

Many projects feign innocence until they rug pull you,I dont understand how people fall for the dumbest schemes easily like that so I started getting deeper into it to understand their background. You see most scheme projects are more likely than not to have the ‘friendliest communities and the most glamorous and eye-catching principles. This is because they want you to blow your wad into their project and then rug pull you. Understand this and youll be able to read a mal project from miles away. Understand how they operate. Not because they only use similar schemes but because they are often run by the same people and the same teams. Even their marketing is often similar and redundant. Watch out for their schemes. They will often approach you in their dms or make invites rewardable to the invitee or make their community into a trickle-down system very fast. The regulation says it all. I dont care about the whitepaper that thing could be written by anyone and could mean absolutely nil. Until they do something that they promise they havent achieved anything. Instead watch for their regulation if they are strict yet direct thats a positive. If they are nice and lenient then you might want to reconsider. That being said there are still new projects out there that you can trust.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        For me there are some small caps I can still have my faith in and make it out clean. These include the Royal Falcons Club for example with their strict regulation and unique reward system. Its efficient clean and manageable. Apply the same standards to your desired prospect and you will be able to measure its authenticity.,1,1.0,0,2022-02-08 12:07:27
What massive price change means to you,If you are a trader for a while you know that a price change any kind of price change is good for you. And positive for your portfolio either on the long-run or the short-run. What you dont want is market stalling when everything does sideways and theres little to no market action around. This is the real danger. Thankfully were out of that and we can get back to our usual investing strategy.Price action is good in either direction. Every chance is a chance for you and I and today the market has finally started moving again in the positive green direction and you should be ready to take advantage of that. Because if you dont someone else will.I dont care what kind of investing you do price action is good for you. This is especially in the case of smaller tokens that have not yet gained major attention on the market. For example the Royal Falcons Club a small NFT project has started making ground again and pulling forward and upwards same could be said for most valid solid small scale projects. Action is action and action is opportunity. This could be the day you make changes or another day where you stay the same your choice. ,1,1.0,0,2022-02-08 11:52:56
A possible future of NFTs ,Take a look at what Ive discovered According to NonFungible. coms year-end report for 2020 the NFT sectors total market capitalization was close to $210 million in 2019. According to the report the market cap could reach $315 million in 2020 and $700 million in 2021.This news demonstrates the markets potential for growth in the near future and it will soon become a great opportunity to profit.So as I predicted the NFTs platform will see significant growth in 2022. As a result many new platforms have been developed to assist in the creation of NFTs. NFT avatar searches have increased since Twitter announced NFT integration on its platform and everyone is trying to get their hands on it.NFT avatar maker I believe may be of assistance to you in this regard. It is a tool that exists that is a all-in-one avatar tool. Users will be able to customise their Avatars by choosing from a growing library of assets that includes billions of combinations and over 1200 different assets like Samurai Masks Superhero Cowls and Golden Skin.,1,1.0,0,2022-02-08 11:06:50
A fish amongst whales,If youre anything like me you probably know what its like to feel like a little fish in a pond full of massive whales. From the day I entered the market Id see people throwing around absurd numbers of dollars at risky bets and I couldnt wrap my head around it. I and you are but a fish among whales. Well that could be either good or bad depends on how you look at it. If youre a small fish you have a lot to gain and little to lose. Unless youre one of those that trade their monthly wage in such a volatile market which I by the way do not suggest. If youre a small fish you are able to take on massive risks and still make it out scot-free. Truth is because you have all to gain and very little to lose. If youre a big bass fish you might want to take it easy. You might want to slow down and hunt APY. I wouldnt know anyway. I havent gotten there yet. So if youre a little fish yes take this with a serious serious grain of salt you might want to take on greater risk. Im not saying draw the lottery in bulk Im saying more like  invest in newer more potential tokens which yes carry on a lot more risk. Im saying things like for example the Royal Falcons Club with their reward system and raffle regulation. Or even MDT or something… Its not easy to be a vulnerable fish in the ocean so be wary but be courageous. ,1,1.0,0,2022-02-08 11:01:19
The time you entered the market tells a lot about your trading state of mind,If you entered in really early and I mean really early youre more likely than not tech-oriented. Youre probably a programmer of some sort and you are probably biased and hold old-school tokens like XRP LTC BTC and ETH on a pedestal. If you jumped on board a little later youre likely to be a big fan of the big BTC and ETH with a couple of side projects who have a large market cap like ADA. You also are likely to have a lot of memecoin side projects like DOGE. Youre also relatively tech-oriented too but younger than the veteran trader. If you entered the market in late Covid times youre probably a Robinhood veteran. You hold your memecoins tight and you know your big 10 crypto assets. You have a little bit of everything and youre not afraid to take risks. If you entered just last year it means you probably started with NFTs or got off the hype and jumped aboard. Nothing wrong with that either just saying. Youre more likely to take massive risks and are relatively inexperienced in the market. Regardless of this none of these people should ignore (but they do) powerful small projects that are brewing up a storm. Im talking here specifically gaming tokens like Kitty Kart for example or Axie. These tokens are bringing in serious hype albeit very very slowly. I find that all these above are incredibly biased and the only people to go for small tokens or small cap projects are those who are shrewd and know what theyre doing. Those who understand the market despite their age and experience.,1,0.6,3,2022-02-08 10:36:37

What Ethereums Buterin Has To Say About Block Time Will Be Much Shorter In The Future,Scaling or lack thereof has been a serious problem with the [Ethereum network development](https//www.blockchainx.tech/erc20-token-development). While various plans are in the works to increase the performance of the platform Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has not shied away from highlighting its limitations.In a reply to a Reddit thread  Buterin highlighted that decreasing block time could lead to nodes with better network connections. All while having an unfair economic advantage over their less fortunate peers. This could lead to risks leading to Ethereum mining or centralized staking.Block time is the time it takes for nodes or validators to verify transactions within a new block and then add it to the networks blockchain.The problem with decreasing the block time in the Proof-of-Work scenario is that the time is randomly assigned Buterin said. This creates a window for blocks to be validated close together. Therefore it gives an advantage to those who have a faster network connection to propagate their own blocks.Now this is negligible at longer block times especially since uncle blocks are still rewarded. Uncle blocks in [Ethereum development](https//www.blockchainx.tech/erc20-token-development) are those that are mined and sent to the ledger around the same time a block is validated.However Proof of Stake is a different ball game according to the co-founder. Ethereum requires thousands of signatures currently around 9100 per slot to be included in the next one. This significantly erodes the possibility of decreasing lock time as it could mean that multiple signatures required for validation would not be recorded on the chain and thus not rewarded.Again this would give those with better connections a head start in the validation process. Therefore sacrificing the spirit of decentralization of the network.In particular although Buterin does not expect that time per slot will be reduced much in the future a solution could be found in single slot purpose. He said*…a single space would actually end a transaction instead of just strongly committing it like it does today. Applications that need really fast commits would have to rely on channels or digests with sequencers that provide early commit.*Furthermore he revealed that the protocol is building a mechanism to provide a strong guarantee after only a few seconds that some transaction will be included in the next block or another in the near future.This is not the first instance where the Ethereum master has highlighted the limitations that even blockchain technology can pose.In the past  Buterin had noted that there are important and quite subtle technical factors that limit blockchain scaling. Especially if equality of nodes and decentralization are to be maintained.,1,1.0,0,2022-02-08 06:05:06
LETS TALK ABOUT tudaFARM YIELD FARMING APYs.,Our proprietary tudaFarm offer will provide single and paired staking as follows BURD; BURD/BNB LP; and BNB. BNB investments will add liquidity automatically and commence farming.Users are not required to hold BURD to access tudaFarm although there is currently a nice price opportunity to invest and earn.To both protect our investors and enable the team to deliver more significant APY earnings farming will have 30 day lock in. tudaFarm will operate on as FCFS (first come first served) early participants may earn larger APYs and can unstake / claim after the 30 day period in the order of entry.tudaFarm will be monitored and as its scale increases the APY will adjust upwards as feasible. Wallets may re-stake doing so will reset the 30 day cycle.Providing a high APY marketplace to BURD holders — who can lend or borrow from the pool — governance tokens will be algorithmically distributed with liquidity incentives. Earning usage fees from users the fees will then be rewarded to the users (the liquidity providers) for staking their BURD in the pool and drive the pool size upwards.APYs will reflect on the tudaFarm page from opening. BNB investments will add liquidity automatically. Users are not required to hold BURD to access tudaFarm.,1,1.0,0,2022-02-08 03:21:03

I think were on our way to finally being able to pay with everything via stable-coin and its honestly incredible.,I dont want to use banks here. I just dont. Theyve rug pulled us and no one really trusts no banks here. I can already use crypto specifically stablecoins like $EURST to pay for my steam games. My spotify and netflix.All of that is cool but I really wish I could buy groceries I could pay rent I could do pretty much everything with stablecoins. Things like Alchemy Pay are working towards making this a reality. It may not seem like that big of a deal for places like the US.

Transparency Series Part One Diving Into Composable Smart Contracts,A big part of BlockApexs philosophy is transparency.

How does this Bull Run affect the small cap coins? ,Ok so we all know how the Bull Run is affecting the large cap coins like ETH and BTC and whatever and its obviously good for all of them though sometimes I have noticed recently is that when the large caps pump the small caps dump. So with this strategy you can actually assess what you must do and how you should act. That being said I think its important during bull runs to buy into small caps early. The thing is often theres a real lag between bull runs in the BTC domination market price and action and small cap price action. So the ideal strategy in this situation is when you a bull run about to start pulling hard i.e. now you might want to buy into a small market capital coin. For example Im using this Bull Run to buy the Royal Falcons Club since their market cap is still humble and their ambition is high. However that is my personal preference so take it with a grain of salt and be careful what you buy. Small cap coins are more profitable but way way riskier. ,1,1.0,2,2022-02-07 09:48:45
These rules from this NFT creator could keep digital artworks safe from hackers,One of the many sectors that grew exponentially within the crypto industry in the past year was non-fungible tokens (NFT development). Its sales volume growth from about $94 million in 2020 to $24.9 billion in 2021 is a clear indication of the same. However emerging financial markets are always at risk of falling victim to criminal elements and NFTs have been no exception.Just last month the story of an art collector who lost $2.2 million worth of NFT in a wallet hack made headlines around the world. Mainly he highlighted the risks that exist in this nascent asset class. A phishing scam had emptied his Ethereum wallet of 15 NFTs valued at a total of $2.2 million including four apes from the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection. He though he was able to retrieve some pieces of his digital art collection with the help of NFTs OpenSea marketplace. However not everyone is lucky.NFT creator Richerd emphasized the same thing on Twitter recently claiming that once an NFT leaves his possession there is nothing he can do to get it back. However this unforgiveness of blockchain technology can be circumvented by following a few steps according to him the most important of which is educating oneself.Apart from this however the founder of the NFT minting platform Manifold suggested that it was imperative to protect the privacy of ones seed phrase. The seed phrase is a generated list of typically 12 to 24 words in a specific order issued to cryptocurrency wallet users to regain access and control of their on-chain funds. In this regard they saidI cant stress this enough there should never be a fingerprint of your seed phrase if someone gets these words then all is lost they will always be in full control of your wallet. No site should ask you for your seed phrase.Furthermore one should also prefer to use a hardware wallet to store their NFTs as assets stored in software wallets could be exposed to malware key loggers screen capture devices and key-seeking file inspectors.Users should also be aware of the URLs they click on as many of them could be scammers looking for an opportunity according to Richerd.Lastly he also stressed that NFT holders should verify the originating website and pay close attention to where they are signing as rushed transactions could be malicious.While NFT enthusiasts can certainly take these steps to protect the NFTs they own the saga of property theft here hardly ends here.Lately various artists around the world have started complaining about their stolen artwork music and other original content created on NFT without their permission. An abundance of piracy in the sector could mean that claims that technology revolutionizes arts patronage finally lose weight.,1,1.0,2,2022-02-07 08:25:56

Fear and greed in a digital market,Listen humans operate on two spectrums fear and greed. All emotions fall within this spectrum. And inappropriately try to appropriate that to everything they do. There are aspects of the human condition where we do need to operate on emotion and it is beneficial such as creation of music art and love. But there are aspects of the human where emotions hold us back and prevent us from reaching our full potential such as sport competition trade and business. There is no place for emotion in business. Emotion is a gift that allows us to love and hate. It lets us express ourselves in a myriad ways for an innumerable set of things. Emotions make us human and there is no never complete separation from our left brain and our right. And thats only fact. It amplifies every activity we do and engraves it in our memory. Fear and Greed are part of our visceral origin and we need to put them under control. Fear makes you understand the dangers of the wolf and lets you understand you should stay away from that risk. Greed makes you hunt down the low-hanging fruit and feed your entire tribe it makes you see what is good for you and pushes you after it. Unfortunately these aspects of the primal man work against you in the market. Greed makes you chase down and try to beat-off a dead horse. And fear keeps you from joining a potentially powerful investment. So which should we go after? Neither. We are blessed with a rare gift of reason. The rare gift over our fellow animal to be able to take in new information reference that with the information we already have and use logic to act upon it. Reason is a tough skill to learn and it takes trial and error but eventually we all learn to do it-to varying degrees. Reason comes into play during sensitive investments. Like for example investing in a small token. ,1,1.0,0,2022-02-07 02:26:01

Growing adoption with the help of Security-token-exchanges,Security token exchanges allow buyers and sellers to trade securities tokens in the same ways as they would on traditional stock exchanges or cryptocurrency exchange platforms. As a result these exchanges play a vital role in the growing adoption of security tokens and are at least partially responsible for creating a healthy playing ground for buyers and sellers to trade.A security token exchange also lets traditional traders take advantage of blockchain offerings while trading familiar assets. Directly or otherwise exchanges provide these traders with the blockchain experience bridging the gap between both worlds and increasing the likelihood of security token adoption. Fusang Exchange lists eligible issuers and connects them with interested investors. Prospective investors can be assured that issuers listed on the exchange passed through comprehensive but straightforward checks to ensure that each one meets all regulatory requirements. The exchange also uses advanced technology and specific solutions to provide an all-inclusive experience for all clients.  Furthermore Fusang ensures that the onboarding process for all parties is easy seamless and tailored to the needs of its users. Issuers and investors can now enjoy traditional assets with advantages only available through blockchain technology.,1,1.0,0,2022-02-06 16:11:14

Leveraging Business Opportunities in the Metaverse.,To those who dont already know the Metaverse is a  virtual environment that provides access to a diverse variety of entertainment and projects leveraging on augmented reality(AR). Think of the Metaverse as a virtual world on the internet where you can do practically everything you can do in the physical world. You can own properties sell properties buy clothing attend concerts and parties etc. For brands seeking to expand their business into the Metaverse there is a world of opportunities therein. Businesses can now create virtual versions of their products and sell them to interested customers on the Metaverse. To be able to adequately leverage on this opportunity it is advantageous to partner with platforms like Suku.world. These platforms have the required infrastructure and tools that allow for optimized customer engagement on the Metaverse. In my opinion expansion into the Metaverse is inevitable and the losers in this game would be the brands that harness these opportunities.,1,1.0,1,2022-02-05 16:45:00
Can there be liberation through cryptocurrency?,Will there be liberation through the crypto movements? Financial freedom precedes cultural freedom. If you give the people back the power to make their own money you can liberate the whole of society. I know this as a fact not as an anecdote because I know what its like to live first-hand in a country crumbling apart and have crypto extend an arm of salvation. I have found financial freedom through cryptocurrency I can work abroad and get paid in dollars rather than work here for minimum wage and get paid in inflated currency that plummets the next day. I am forever grateful and thankful for crypto currency for rescuing me and thus I feel it is my job to point others to this chance. Especially those less privileged than I those who live in countries and governments where the value of their work is chosen for them. Take the leap and join the cryptocurrency waves of change before it overtakes you. This is your one chance at reclaiming you destiny. Love your fate but embrace opportunity. Take whatever chances you get. I like to think that everything that exists today could and might be successful one day so I never let myself miss out on any opportunity and study well and deep every nook and cranny of the crypto market. Someone suggested to me that I look into the Royal Falcons Club and I delved in it deep before I bought it. Because I know if it takes off it will lift me from my miserable fate. You should look into opportunities and chances too before they pass you by. Every chance is once in a lifetime never let one miss you by. ,1,1.0,2,2022-02-05 14:07:14

In the crypto world utility and community with efficiency are the future. There are a few projects that should be on your radar.,Its a common misconception that as more people use utility tokens the tokens value will rise. When the demand for utility tokens exceeds the supply the tokens value rises. People are gravitating toward cause-based projects which are referred to as utility-based tokens in the crypto world as adoption grows.More and more crypto projects are attempting to get their hands on social media in order to build a strong community as having a strong community behind you will never let you down and this will help to raise awareness about the project.In terms of being both useful and efficient weve seen what ripple BAT and Algorand have accomplished. These ecosystem-building projects could have a big impact. Another project that helps humans in Africa is the bob eco coin. This is a fresh face on the scene! Tens of thousands of jobs have been created as a result of the world of Security Tokens and their use of EVs.Cryptocurrency is gaining traction in a number of industries including finance healthcare and management. Aave Fantom and Pancake Swap are all great innovations in the field of finance-based crypto currencies.,1,1.0,0,2022-02-05 10:12:38
Crypto changing lives or blockchain changing lives?,Cryptocurrencies brought blockchain technology hand in hand with the economic idea of decentralization and anonymity. This brought a new world for the economy and for investments which meant a huge market capitalization brought with it advantages and disadvantages.But one thing that undoubtedly happened is that the development of blockchain changed the economy and the lives of many people.After Bitcoin the phenomenon of boom and rapid capitalization was repeated by the next blockchain developments such as Ethereum.Decentralized blockchain development protocols such as DIG focus part of their team on researching the next startups to find the next blockchain technology revolution.Reddit do you think the next blockchain revolution will change the economy?,1,1.0,0,2022-02-05 09:43:25

Nintendo is showing interest in Gaming NFTs,  Yup you heard that right. If Nintendo takes this leap theres no coming back. Its a little worrying that you got gaming tokens like Axie and Kitty Kart getting slower and moving sideways but news like this will move it all back up where it should be. I think this is every kids dream to play a Nintendo game and make money imagine how much can be made from this or how big this could be. Im bullish on this I was bullish on this to behin with. Now that Nintendo is showing interest Im more bullish than ever and I think theres no coming back from this it was only time…,1,1.0,1,2022-02-05 07:35:47

 No it is not too late you are just lazy ,I hear these people talking about how it is too late to invest in crypto and that crypto has peaked and people at their barber shop are talking about it now as well as talking about NFTs or whatever. Guess what. Its not really that late. You are jst lazyTruth is theres a lot to be still made in the crypto market. Whether that be profit-speaking or actual project ideas you want to talk about. Crypto right now is like that vast ocean when sailors started to jump into the ocean searching for new lands beyond the horizon. The possibilities are limitless. And trust me yeah you want to be on the side the sailors. You want to be on the winning side. Fortune favours the bold. Sorry to be stealing this line from the now defamed crypto exchange but this is the truth. Only those that go beyond the treaded path reach where no one has before. This is the truth of the matter of it all and you cant change it no matter what you do. Instead of weeping about how it is too late for you to buy BTC at one dollar save yourself some future tears and buy some new projects out there that you believe might eventually make it to the top of the food chain. Projects like the Royal Falcons Club with their unique mechanism and reward operation. Look into the future please and buy what you think creates value. Spend money where you make money and invest in a future that could be yours.  ,1,1.0,0,2022-02-04 23:05:07
Dumptrucks everywhere I look,You think youre smart? Staking your coins and making that single digit APY that youre proud of? In case you didnt notice while the market was down and crashing the whales were accumulating. And now youve got folks like Putin chasing back cryptocurrency and you werent there to buy the dip. This should not have been how it was. You should have bought the dip and you should have secured yourself and your future. This could have been your shot. This could have been the year you turn from undesirable to undeniable. Fortuanately its not exactly that late to make it back again. There are still small projects out there in the market you can buy at no premium for pretty cheap. In fact go ahead and do your research. Look at tokens making work like the Royal Falcons Club and their team that is literally handing out reward like candy at a Halloween party. I repeat. Its not too late you just gotta open your eyes and do some actual research. ,1,1.0,0,2022-02-04 22:53:59
